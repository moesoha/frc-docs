"When using source control the project will typically be used on a number "
"of computers and the path to the project directory might be different "
"from one users computer to another. If the RobotBuilder project file is "
"stored using an absolute path, it will typically contain the user name "
"and won't be usable across multiple computers. To make this work, select "
"\"relative path\" and specify the path as an directory offset from the "
"project files. In the above example, the project file is stored in the "
"folder just above the project files in the file hierarchy. In this case, "
"the user name is not part of the path and it will be portable across all "
"of your computers."
