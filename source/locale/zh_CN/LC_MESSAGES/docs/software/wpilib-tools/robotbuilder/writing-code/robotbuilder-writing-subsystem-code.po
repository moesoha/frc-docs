"Adding code to create an actual working subsystem is very "
"straightforward. For simple subsystems that don't use feedback it turns "
"out to be extremely simple. In this section we will look at an example of"
" a Claw subsystem that operates the motor for some amount of time to open"
" or close a claw on the robot arm."

"The claw at the end of a robot arm is a subsystem operated by a single "
"Victor speed controller. There are three things we want the claw to do, "
"start opening, start closing, and stop moving. This is the responsibility"
" of the subsystem. The timing for opening and closing will be handled by "
"a command later in this tutorial."

"Add methods to the claw.java that will open, close, and stop the claw "
"from moving. Those will be used by commands that actually operate the "
"claw. The comments have been removed from this file to make it easier to "
"see the changes for this document. Notice that a member variable called "
"\"victor\" is created by RobotBuilder so it can be used throughout the "
"subsystem. Each of your dragged-in palette items will have a member "
"variable with the name given in RobotBuilder."
