"Commands are classes you create that provide behaviors or actions for "
"your subsystems. The subsystem class should set the operation of the "
"subsystem, like MoveElevator to start the elevator moving, or "
"ElevatorToSetPoint to set the elevator's PID setpoint. The commands "
"initiate the subsystem operation and keep track of when it is finished."
