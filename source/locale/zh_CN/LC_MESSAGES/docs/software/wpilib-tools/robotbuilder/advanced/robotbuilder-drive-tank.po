"A common use case is to have a joystick that should drive some actuators "
"that are part of a subsystem. The problem is that the joystick is created"
" in the OI class and the motors to be controlled are in the subsystem. "
"The idea is to create a command that, when scheduled, reads input from "
"the joystick and calls a method that is created on the subsystem that "
"drives the motors."

"Create a subsystem called Drive Train. Its responsibility will be to "
"handle the driving for the robot base. Inside the Drive Train is a Robot "
"Drive object for a two motor drive robot (in this case). There is a left "

"Create a method that takes the joystick inputs, in this case the the left"

"Create a command, in this case called DriveWithJoysticks. Its purpose "

"The last step is to make the DriveWIthJoysticks command be the \"Default "
"Command\" for the Drive Train subsystem. This means that whenever no "
"other command is using the Drive Train, the Joysticks will be in control."
" This is probably the desirable behavior. When the autonomous code is "
"running, it will also require the drive train and interrupt the "
"\"DriveWithJoystick\" command. When the autonomous code is finished, the "
"DriveWithJoysticks command will restart automatically (because it is the "
"default command), and the operators will be back in control. If you write"
" any code that does teleop automatic driving, those commands should also "
"\"require\" the DriveTrain so that they too will interrupt the "
"DriveWithJoysticks command and have full control."
