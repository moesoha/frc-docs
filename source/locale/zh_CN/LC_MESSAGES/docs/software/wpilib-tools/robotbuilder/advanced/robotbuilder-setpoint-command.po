"A common use case in robot programs is to drive an actuator to a "
"particular angle or position that is measured using a potentiometer or "
"encoder. This happens so often that there is a shortcut in RobotBuilder "
"to do this task. It is called the Setpoint command and it's one of the "
"choices on the palette or the right-click context menu that can be "
"inserted under \"Commands\"."

"Suppose in a robot there is a wrist joint with a potentiometer that "
"measures the angle. First :doc:`create a PIDSubsystem <../writing-code"
"/robotbuilder-writing-pidsubsystem-code>` that include the motor that "
"moves the wrist joint and the potentiometer that measures the angle. The "
"PIDSubsystem should have all the PID constants filled in and working "
"properly."

"It is important to set the **Tolerance** parameter. This controls how far"
" off the current value can be from the setpoint and be considered on "
"target. This is the criteria that the SetpointCommand uses to move onto "

"Whenever this command is scheduled, it will automatically drive the "

"the tolerance specified in the PIDSubsystem, the command ends and the "
"next command starts. It is important to specify a tolerance in the "
"PIDSubsystem or this command might never end because the tolerance is not"
" achieved."
