"Mecanum drive is a method of driving using specially designed wheels that"
" allow the robot to drive in any direction without changing the "
"orientation of the robot. A robot with a conventional drivetrain (4 or "
"six wheels) must turn in the direction it needs to drive. A mecanum robot"
" can move in any direction without first turning and is called a "
"holonomic drive."

"The wheels shown in this robot have rollers that cause the forces from "
"driving to be applied at a 45 degree angle rather than straight forward "
"as in the case of a conventional drive. You might guess that varying the "
"speed of the wheels results in travel in any direction. You can look up "
"how mecanum wheels work on various web sites on the internet."

msgid ""
"Here's a sample program that shows the minimum code to drive using a "
"single joystick and mecanum wheels. It uses the RobotDrive object that is"
" available in both C++ and Java so even though this example is in C++ "
"similar code will work in Java. The idea is to create the RobotDrive "
"object with 4 PWM ports for the 4 speed controllers on the robot. The "
"joystick XY position represents a direction vector that the robot should "
"follow regardless of its orientation. The twist axis on the joystick "
"represents the rate of rotation for the robot while it's driving."

"I would be remiss in not mentioning that is a 4th parameter to the "
"``MecanumDrive_Cartesian()`` method that is the angle returned from a "
"Gyro sensor. This will adjust the rotation value supplied, in this case, "
"from the twist axis of the joystick to be relative to the field rather "
"than relative to the robot. This is particularly useful with mecanum "
"drive since, for the purposes of steering, the robot really has no front,"
" back or sides. It can go in any direction. Adding the angle in degrees "
"from a gyro object will cause the robot to move away from the drivers "
"when the joystick is pushed forwards, and towards the drivers when it is "
"pulled towards them - regardless of what direction the robot is facing!"

"The use of field-oriented driving makes often makes the robot much easier"
" to drive, especially compared to a \"robot-oriented\" drive system where"
" the controls are reversed when the robot is facing the drivers."
