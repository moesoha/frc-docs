"Commands handle the behaviors for your robot. The command starts a "
"subsystem to some operating mode like raising and elevator and continues "
"running until it reaches some setpoint or timeout. The command then "
"handles waiting for the subsystem to finish. That way commands can run in"
" sequence to develop more complex behaviors."
