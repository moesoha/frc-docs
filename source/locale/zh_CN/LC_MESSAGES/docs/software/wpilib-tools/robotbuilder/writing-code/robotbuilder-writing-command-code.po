"Subsystem classes get the mechanisms on your robot moving, but to get it "
"to stop at the right time and sequence through more complex operations "
"you write Commands. Previously in :doc:`writing the code for a subsystem "
"<robotbuilder-writing-subsystem-code>` we developed the code for the Claw"
" subsystem on a robot to start the claw opening, closing, or to stop "
"moving. Now we will write the code for a command that will actually run "
"the Claw motor for the right time to get the claw to open and close. Our "
"claw example is a very simple mechanism where we run the motor for 1 "
"second to open it or 0.9 seconds to close it."

"RobotBuilder will generate the class files for the Closeclaw command. The"
" command represents the behavior of the claw, that is the operation over "
"time. To operate this very simple claw mechanism the motor needs to "
"operate for 1 second in the close direction. The Claw subsystem has "
"methods to start the motor running in the right direction and to stop it."
" The commands responsibility is to run the motor for the correct time. "
"The lines of code that are shown in the boxes are added to add this "
"behavior."

"The ``Interrupted()`` method is called is this command is interrupted if "
"another command that also requires the Claw subsystem is scheduled before"
" this finishes. For example, if the Closeclaw command was scheduled and "
"running, then the Openclaw command was scheduled it would interrupt the "
"Openclaw command, call its Interrupted() method, and the motor would "
"stop."
