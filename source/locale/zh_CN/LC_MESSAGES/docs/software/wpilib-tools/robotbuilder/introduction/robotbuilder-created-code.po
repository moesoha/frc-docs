"A RobotBuilder generated project consists of a package (in Java) or a "
"folder (in C++) for Commands and another for Subsystems (1). Each command"
" or subsystem object is stored under those containers (2). At the top "
"level of the project you'll find the robot main program (Robot.java), the"
" Operator Interface file (OI.java) and the RobotMap that contains the "
"code to create all the subsystem components that were added to the robot "
"description."

"When the robot description is modified and code is re-exported "
"RobotBuilder is designed to not modify any changes you made to the file, "
"thus preserving your code. This makes RobotBuilder a full-lifecycle tool."
" To know what code is OK to be modified by RobotBuilder, it generates "
"sections that will potentially have to be rewritten delimited with some "
"special comments. These comments are shown in the example above. Don't "
"add any code within these comment blocks, it will be rewritten next time "
"the project is exported from RobotBuilder."

"If code inside one of these blocks must be modified, the comments can be "
"removed, but this will prevent further updates from happening later. In "
"the above example, if the //BEGIN and //END comments were removed, then "
"later another required subsystem was added in RobotBuilder, it would not "
"be generated on that next export."
