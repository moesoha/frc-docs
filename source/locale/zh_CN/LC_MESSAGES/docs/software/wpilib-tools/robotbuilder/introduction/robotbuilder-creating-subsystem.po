"Subsystems are classes that encapsulate (or contain) all the data and "
"code that make a subsystem on your robot operate. The first step in "
"creating a robot program with the RobotBuilder is to identify and create "
"all the subsystems on the robot. Examples of subsystems are grippers, "
"ball collectors, the drive base, elevators, arms, etc. Each subsystem "
"contains all the sensors and actuators that are used to make it work. For"
" example, an elevator might have a Jaguar speed controller and a "
"potentiometer to provide feedback of the robot position."
