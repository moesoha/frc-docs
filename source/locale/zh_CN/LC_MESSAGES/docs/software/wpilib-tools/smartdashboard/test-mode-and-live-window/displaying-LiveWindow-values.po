"Typically LiveWindows are displayed as part of the automatically "
"generated RobotBuilder code. You may also display LiveWindow values by "
"writing the code yourself and adding it to your robot program. LiveWindow"
" will display values grouped in subsystems. This is a convenient method "
"of displaying whether they are actual command based program subsystems or"
" just a grouping that you decide to use in your program."

"**(1)** Get a reference (in Java) or a pointer (in C++) to the LiveWindow"
" object in your program. **(2)** Then for each sensor or actuator that is"
" created, add it to the LiveWindow display by either calling "
"``AddActuator`` or ``AddSensor`` (``addActuator`` or ``addSensor`` in "
"Java). When the SmartDashboard is put into LiveWindow mode, it will "
"display the sensors and actuators."

"The sensors and actuators added to the LiveWindow will be displayed "
"grouped by subsystem. The subsystem name is just an arbitrary grouping "
"the helping to organize the display of the sensors. Actuators can be "
"operated by operating the slider for the two motor controllers."
