"Often debugging or monitoring the status of a robot involves writing a "
"number of values to the console and watching them stream by. With "
"SmartDashboard you can put values to a GUI that is automatically "
"constructed based on your program. As values are updated, the "
"corresponding GUI element changes value - there is no need to try to "
"catch numbers streaming by on the screen."

"You can write Boolean, Numeric, or String values to the SmartDashboard by"
" simply calling the correct method for the type and including the name "
"and the value of the data, no additional code is required. Any time in "
"your program that you write another value with the same name, it appears "
"in the same UI element on the screen on the driver station or development"
" computer. As you can imagine this is a great way of debugging and "
"getting status of your robot as it is operating."

"Widgets are populated on the SmartDashboard automatically, no user "
"intervention is required. Note that the widgets are only populated when "
"the value is first written, you may need to enable your robot in a "
"particular mode or trigger a particular code routine for an item to "
"appear. To alter the appearance of the widget, see the next two sections "
"Changing the Display Properties of a Value and Changing the Display "
"Widget Type for a Value."
