"The PID (Proportional, Integral, Differential) is an algorithm for "
"determining the motor speed based on sensor feedback to reach a setpoint "
"as quickly as possible. For example, a robot with an elevator that moves "
"to a predetermined position should move there as fast as possible then "
"stop without excessive overshoot leading to oscillation. Getting the PID "
"controller to behave this way is called \"tuning\". The idea is  to "
"compute an error value that is the difference between the current value "
"of the mechanism feedback element and the desired (setpoint) value. In "
"the case of the arm, there might be a potentiometer connected to an "
"analog channel that provides a voltage that is proportional to the "
"position of the arm. The desired value is the voltage that is "
"predetermined for the position the arm should move to, and the current "
"value is the voltage for the actual position of the arm."

"Create a PID Subsystem for each mechanism with feedback. The PID "
"Subsystems contain the actuator (motor) and the feedback sensor "
"(potentiometer in this case). You can use Test mode to display the "
"subsystem sensors and actuators. Using the slider manually adjust the "
"actuator to each desired position. Note the sensor values (2) for each of"
" the desired positions. These will become the setpoints for the PID "
"controller."

"In Test mode, the PID Subsystems display their P, I, and D parameters "
"that are set in the code. The P, I, and D values are the weights applied "
"to the computed error (P), sum of errors over time (I), and the rate of "
"change of errors (D). Each of those terms is multiplied by the weights "
"and added together to form the motor value. Choosing the optimal P, I, "
"and D values can be difficult and requires some amount of "
"experimentation. The Test mode on the robot allows the values to be "
"modified, and the mechanism response observed."

"Tuning the PID controller can be difficult and there are many articles "
"that describe techniques that can be used. It is best to start with the P"
" value first. To try different values fill in a low number for P, enter a"
" setpoint determined earlier in this document, and note how fast the "
"mechanism responds. If it responds too slowly, perhaps never reaching the"
" setpoint, increase P. If it responds too quickly, perhaps oscillating, "
"reduce the P value. Repeat this process until you get a response that is "
"as fast as possible without oscillation. It's possible that having a P "
"term is all that's needed to achieve adequate control of your mechanism."
