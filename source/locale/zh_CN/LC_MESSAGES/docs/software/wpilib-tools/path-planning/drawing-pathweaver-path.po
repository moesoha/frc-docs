"The main feature of PathWeaver is that it allows the path the robot will "
"follow to be easily visualized. In the following picture you can see a "
"path that goes from a robot starting point to a finish point that follows"
" a smooth path with minimum accelerating and decelerating. Paths can have"
" any number of waypoints that can allow more complex driving to be "
"described. In this case there are 5 waypoints (including the start and "
"stop) depicted with the triangle icons. Each waypoint consists of a X, Y "
"position on the field as well as a robot heading described as the X and Y"
" tangent lines."

"Notice also that the path shows the left and right wheel tracks as well "
"as the robot centerline to make it easier to visualize the robot on the "
"path and avoid obstacles. To get better performance, PathWeaver draws the"
" path when you are interactively manipulating it using an estimation "
"algorithm. The three depicted paths (left, right, and center) are "
"computed using a PathFinder generated path when you stop editing the "
"waypoints. This is the same data that the robot will use to actually "
"follow the path while driving. The following sections will show how to "
"create this path."

"To start creating a path, click the + (plus) button in the path window. A"
" default path will be created that probably does not have the proper "
"start and end points. The path also shows the tangent vectors (teal "
"lines) for the start and end points. By changing the angle of the tangent"
" vectors, the path followed is affected."

"Drag the start and end points of the path to the desired locations. "
"Notice that in this case, the path drives through the edge of a field "
"element (Switch from the FRC 2018 game) and ends with the robot facing "
"towards the bottom of the field drawing. The path should instead drive "
"around the Switch and end up pointing towards the Scale."

"The robot heading can be changed by dragging the tangent vector (teal) "
"line to that it faces the Scale side. That causes the robot to end the "
"path facing in the right direction, but it now is driving through the "

msgid ""
"Adding additional waypoints and changing their tangent vectors can affect"
" the path that is followed. Additional waypoints can be added by dragging"
" in the middle of the path. In this case, adding two additional waypoints"
" for the first turn and another waypoint for the final turn will help the"
" robot make the turns more smoothly without collisions."

msgid ""
"While PathWeaver makes it simple to draw paths that the robot should "
"follow, it is sometimes hard to precisely set where the waypoints should "
"be placed. In this case, setting the waypoint locations can be done by "
"entering the X and Y value which might come from an accurate CAD model of"
" the field. The points can be entered in the X and Y fields when a "
"waypoint is selected."

msgid ""
"There are times when multiple related paths might be necessary. For "
"example, a red vs. blue side where something isn't symmetric or transpose"
" of the X or Y axis would be needed. In this case a path can be "
"duplicated, then the Horizontal or Vertical axis can be flipped between "
"the old path and the duplicate. To do this create a duplicate path using "
"the \"Duplicate\" button, then use the \"Flip H\" or \"Flip V\" buttons "
"for the new path to modify it."
