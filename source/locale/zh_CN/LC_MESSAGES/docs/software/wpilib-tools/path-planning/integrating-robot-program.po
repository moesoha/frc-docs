"This article describes the process of writing a program that can use a "
"stored path and have the robot follow it. The robot for this example is "
"based on the TimedRobot template class and has left and right driven 4\" "
"wheels connected to motors with encoders on each side. In addition the "
"robot has an Analog Gyro that is used to help make sure the robot "
"hardware is keeping up with each generated point. The following code is "
"heavily taken from `Jaci's Pathfinder's wiki "
"<https://github.com/JacisNonsense/Pathfinder/wiki/Pathfinder-for-FRC---"
"Java>`__. This is because the paths PathWeaver generates are Pathfinder "
"paths and Pathfinder must be added as a `vendor dependency "
"<https://imjac.in/dev/maven/frc/7194a2d4-2860-4bcc-86c0-97879737d875>`__."
