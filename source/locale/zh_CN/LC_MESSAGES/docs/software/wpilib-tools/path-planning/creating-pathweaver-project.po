"PathWeaver is started by clicking on the ellipsis icon in the top right "

"**Project directory:** this is normally top level project directory that "
"contains the build.gradle and src files for your robot program. Choosing "
"this directory is the expected way to use PathWeaver and will cause it to"
" locate all the output files in the correct directories for automatic "
"path deployment to your robot."

"**Length Unit:** the units to be used in describing your robot and for "

"**Time Step:** is the time that each generated point should be driven. "
"Shorter time steps cause more points to be generated and may "
"significantly improve the accuracy of the followed path. If you are using"
" the default TimedRobot class, we recommend using a time step of 20ms or "
"0.02 seconds."

"**Max Velocity:** the maximum speed attainable by your robot. This is the"
" most important parameter of the robot profile since it causes generated "
"paths to never exceed this speed. You can either calculate this velocity "
"using knowledge of your robot design or by measuring it. One method of "
"measuring the Max Velocity is driving in a straight line then measuring "
"the speed after the robot has reached full speed. Another method is "
"spinning in place at full speed for 10 rotations and using the formula "
"for circumference divided by 10 for total distance traveled and the time "
"to complete for the distance traveled."
