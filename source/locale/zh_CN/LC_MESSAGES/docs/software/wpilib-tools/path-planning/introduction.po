"Autonomous is an important section of the match; it is exciting when "
"robots do impressive things in autonomous. In order to score, the robot "
"usually need to go somewhere. The faster the robot arrives at that "
"location, the sooner it can score points! The traditional method for "
"autonomous is driving in a straight line, turning to a certain angle, and"
" driving in a straight line again. This approach works fine, but the "
"robot spends a non-negligible amount of time stopping and starting again "
"after each straight line and turn."

"A more advanced approach to autonomous is called “path planning”. Instead"
" of driving in a straight line and turning once the line is complete, the"
" robot continuously moves, driving with a curve-like motion. This can "
"reduce turning stoppage time."

"Paths have position and velocity values. A path has a list of position "
"and velocity values for the robot every x seconds (usually 0.02 seconds "
"or less). The robot then attempts to follow these points, adjusting using"
" PID control when needed."

"Many teams and organizations have created path planning libraries for "
"FRC, but the officially supported library for WPILib is Pathfinder, which"
" can be added as a vendor library by adding this vendor JSON using the "
"**Manage Libraries->Install New Libraries (online)** function in VSCode "
"(see the `3rd Party Libraries <../../getting-started/3rd-party-"
"libraries.html>`__ article for more details): "
