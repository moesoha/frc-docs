"Lists are sets of tiles that are be logically grouped together in a "
"vertical layout. When tiles are added to a list,it becomes visually "
"obvious that the tiles are related in function. In addition tiles in "
"lists take up less screen space than the same tiles directly on the "
"desktop because tiles in a list don't display the dark window title, but "
"instead display a smaller textual label documenting the contents of the "
"list."

"will be at the top of it. Notice that tiles in lists do not have the "
"window title at the top, but instead have the text that was in the window"
" title."
