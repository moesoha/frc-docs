"``withSize`` sets the number of columns wide and rows high the widget "
"should be. For example, calling ``withSize(1, 1)`` makes the widget "
"occupy a single cell in the grid. Note that some widgets have a minimum "
"size that may be greater than the specified size, in which case the "
"widget will use the smallest supported size."

"``withPosition`` sets the row and column of the top-left corner of the "
"widget. Rows and columns are both 0-indexed, so the topmost row is number"
" 0 and the leftmost column is also number 0. If the position of any "
"widget in a tab is specified, every widget should also have its position "
"set to avoid overlapping widgets."

"If there are many widgets in a tab with related data, it can be useful to"
" place them into smaller subgroups instead of loose in the tab. Much like"
" how the handle to a tab is retrieved with ``Shuffleboard.getTab``, a "
"layout inside a tab (or even in another layout) can be retrieved with "
"``ShuffleboardTab.getLayout``."
