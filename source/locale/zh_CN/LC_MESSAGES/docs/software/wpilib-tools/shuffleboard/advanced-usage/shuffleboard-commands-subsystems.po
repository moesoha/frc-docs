"Shuffleboard will display the subsystem name, the default command "
"associated with this subsystem, and the currently running command. In "
"this example the default command for the Elevator subsystem is called "
"``AutonomousCommand`` and it is also the current command that is using "
"the Elevator subsystem."

"In Test mode (Test/Enabled in the driver station) subsystems may be "
"displayed in the LiveWindow tab with the sensors and actuators of the "
"subsystem. This is ideal for verifying of sensors are working by seeing "
"the values that they are returning. In addition, actuators can be "
"operated. For example, motors can be operated using sliders to set their "
"commanded speed and direction. For PIDSubsystems the P, I, D, and F "
"constants are displayed along with the setpoint and an enable control. "
"This is useful for tuning PIDSubsystems by adjusting the constants, "
"putting in a setpoint, and enabling the embedded PIDController. Then the "
"mechanism's response can be observed. This cycle (change parameters, "
"enable, and observe) can be repeated until a reasonable set of parameters"
" is found."

"Using commands and subsystems makes very modular robot programs that can "
"easily be tested and modified. Part of this is because commands can be "
"written completely independently of other commands and can therefor be "
"easily run from Shuffleboard. To write a command to Shuffleboard use the "
"``SmartDashboard.putData`` method as shown here:"

"Shuffleboard will display the command name and a button to execute the "
"command. In this way individual commands and command groups can easily be"
" tested without needing special test code in a robot program. In the "
"image below there are a number of commands contained in a Shuffleboard "
"list. Pressing the button once runs the command and pressing it again "
"stops the command. To use this feature the robot must be enabled in "
"teleop mode."
