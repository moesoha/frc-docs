"Shuffleboard is a dashboard for FRC based on newer technologies such as "
"JavaFX that are available to Java programs. It is designed to be used for"
" creating dashboards for C++ and Java programs. If you've used "
"SmartDashboard in the past then you are already familiar with many of the"
" features of Shuffleboard since they fundamentally work the same way. But"
" Shuffleboard has many features that aren't in SmartDashboard. Here are "
"some of the highlights:"

"Graphics is based on **JavaFX**, the Java graphics standard. Each of the "
"components has an associated style sheet so it becomes possible to have "
"different \"skins\" or \"themes\" for Shuffleboard. We supply default "
"light and dark themes."

"Shuffleboard supports **multiple sheets for the display of your data**. "
"In fact you can create a new sheet (shown as a tab in the Shuffleboard "
"window) and indicate if and which data should be autopopulated on it. By "
"default there is a Test tab and a SmartDashboard tab that are "
"autopopulated as data arrives. Other tabs might be for robot debugging "
"vs. driving."

"Graphical **display elements (widgets) are laid out on a grid** to keep "
"the interface clean and easy to read. You can change the grid size to "
"have more or less resolution in your layouts and visual cues are provided"
" to help you change your layout using drag and drop. Or you can choose to"
" turn off the grid lines although the grid layout is preserved."
