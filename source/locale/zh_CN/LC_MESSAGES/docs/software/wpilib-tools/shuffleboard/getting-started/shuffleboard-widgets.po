"values that the robot program publishes with NetworkTables."

"Widgets can be moved simply with drag and drop. Just move the cursor over"
" the widget, left-click and drag it to the new position. When dragging "
"you can only place widgets on grid squares and the size of the grid will "
"effect the resolution of your display. When dragging a red or green "
"outline will be displayed. Green generally means that there is enough "
"room at the current location to drop the widget and red generally means "
"that it will overlap or be too big to drop. In the example below a widget"
" is being moved to a location where it doesn't fit."

"Widgets can be resized by clicking and dragging the edge or corner of the"
" widget image. The cursor will change to a resize-cursor when it is in "
"the right position to resize the widget. As with moving widgets, a green "
"or red outline will be drawn indicating that the widget can be resized or"
" not. The example below shows a widget being resized to a larger area "
"with the green outline indicating that there is no overlap with "
"surrounding widgets."

"Shuffleboard is very rich in display types depending on the data "
"published from the robot. It will automatically choose a default display "
"type, but you might want to change it depending on the application. To "
"see what the possible displays are for any widget, right-click on the "
"widget and select the \"Show as...\" and from the popup menu, choose the "
"desired type. In the example below are two data values, one a number and "
"the other a boolean. You can see the different types of display options "
"that are available to each. The boolean value has only two possible "
"values (true/false) it can be shown as a boolean box (the red/green "
"color), or text, or a toggle button or toggle switch. The. number value "
"can be displayed as a graph, number bar, number slider, dial, text, or a "
"voltage view depending on the context of the value."

"You can change the title of widgets by double-clicking in their title bar"
