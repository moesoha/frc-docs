"Shuffleboard is a tabbed interface. Each tab organizes widgets in a "
"logical grouping. By default, Shuffleboard has tabs for the legacy "
"SmartDashboard and LiveWindow - but new tabs can now be created in "
"Shuffleboard directly from a robot program for better organization."

"Creating a new tab is as simple as calling a single method on the "
"Shuffleboard class, which will create a new tab on Shuffleboard and "
"return a handle for adding your data to the tab. Calling getTab multiple "

"This method lets a tab be selected by title. This is case-sensitive (so "
"\"Tab Title\" and \"Tab title\" are two individual tabs), and only works "
"if a tab with that title exists at the time the method is called, so "
"calling ``selectTab(\"Example\")``\\ will only have an effect if a tab "
"named \"Example\" has previously been defined."
