"One challenge in using sensors to control mechanisms is to have a good "
"algorithm to drive the motors to the proper position or speed. The most "
"commonly used control algorithm is called PID control.  There is a `good "
"set of videos <https://wp.wpi.edu/wpilib/robotics-videos/>`__ (look for "
"the robot controls playlist) that explain the control algorithms "
"described here The PID algorithm converts sensor values into motor speeds"

"Reading sensor values to determine how far the robot or mechanism from "
"the desired setpoint. The setpoint is the sensor value that corresponds "
"to the expected goal. For example, a robot arm with a wrist joint should "
"be able to move to a specified angle very quickly and stop at that angle "
"as indicated by a sensor. A potentiometer is a sensor that can measure. "
"rotational angle. By connecting it to an analog input, the program can "
"get a voltage measurement that is directly proportional to the angle."

"Compute an error (the difference between the sensor value and the desired"
" value). The sign of the error value indicates which side of the setpoint"
" the wrist is on. For example negative values might indicate that the "
"measured wrist angle is larger than the desired wrist angle. The "
"magnitude of the error is how far the measured wrist angle is from the "
"actual wrist angle. If the error is zero, then the measured angle exactly"
" matches the desired angle. The error can be used as an input to the PID "
"algorithm to compute a motor speed."

"I (integral) - this term is the sum of successive errors. The longer the "
"error exists the larger the integral contribution will be. It is simply a"
" sum of all the errors over time. If the wrist isn't quite getting to the"
" setpoint because of a large load it is trying to move, the integral term"
" will continue to increase (sum of the errors) until it contributes "
"enough to the motor speed to get it to move to the setpoint. The sum of "
"the errors is multiplied by a constant (Ki) to scale the integral term "
"for the system."

"D (differential) - this value is the rate of change of the errors. It is "
"used to slow down the motor speed if it's moving too fast. It's computed "
"by taking the difference between the current error value and the previous"
" error value. It is also multiplied by a constant (kd) to scale it to "
"match the rest of the system."

"Tuning the PID controller consists of picking constants that will give "
