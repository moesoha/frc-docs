"With Shuffleboard you can graph numeric values over time. Graphs are "
"very. useful to see how sensor or motor values are changing as your robot"
" is operating. For example the sensor value can be graphed in a PID loop "
"to see how it is responding during tuning."

"The graph widget shows line plots of the value that you selected. It will"
" automatically set the scale and the default time interval that the graph"
" will show will be 30 seconds. You can change that in the setting for the"

"For related values it is often desirable to show multiple values on the "
"same graph. To do that, simply drag additional values from the "
"NetworkTable source view (left side of the Shuffleboard window) and drop "
"it onto the graph and that value will be added as shown below. You can "
"continue to drag additional values onto the graph."
