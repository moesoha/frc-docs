"Camera streams from the robot can be viewed on a tab in Shuffleboard. "
"This is useful for viewing what the robot is seeing to give a less "
"obstructed view for operators or helping visualize the output from a "
"vision algorithm running on the driver station computer or a coprocessor "
"on the robot. Any stream that is running using the CameraServer API can "
"be viewed in a camera stream widget."

"To add a camera to your dashboard select \"Sources\" and view the "
"\"CameraServer\" source in the left side panel in the Shuffleboard window"
" as shown in the example below. A list of camera streams will be shown, "
"in this case there is only one camera called \"Robot Front Camera\". Drag"
" that to the tab where it should be displayed. Alternatively the stream "
"can also be placed on the dashboard by right-clicking on the stream in "
"the Sources list and selecting \"Show as: Camera Stream\"."
