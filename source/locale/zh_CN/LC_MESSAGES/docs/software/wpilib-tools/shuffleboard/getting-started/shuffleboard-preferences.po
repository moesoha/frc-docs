"Shuffleboard positions tiles on a grid when you are adding or moving them"
" yourself or when they are auto-populated. You can set the default tile "
"size when for each tab or it can be set globally for all the tabs created"
" after the default setting is changed. Finer resolution in the grid "
"results in finer control over placement of tiles. This can be set in the "
"Shuffleboard Preferences window as shown below."

"Shuffleboard will default to saving your layout when you exit the "
"application. You can also save it explicitly using the File / Save and "
"File / Save as... menu options. The preferences window has options to "
"cause the previous layout to be automatically applied when Shuffleboard "
"starts. In addition, Shuffleboard will always display a \"Save layout\" "
"window to remind you to save the layout. You can choose to turn off the "
"automatic prompt on exit, but be sure to save the layout manually in this"
" case so you don't loose your changes."

"information. If you're running on a computer without the Driver Station, "
"you can manually enter your team number or the robotRIO network address."
