"Your robot can display data in regular operating modes like Teleop and "
"Autonomous modes but you can also display the status and operate all the "
"robot subsystems when the robot is switched to Test mode. By default "
"you'll see two tabs when you start Shuffleboard, one for "
"Teleop/Autonomous and another for Test mode. The currently selected tab "
"is underlined as can be seen in the picture below."

"Often debugging or monitoring the status of a robot involves writing a "
"number of values to the console and watching them stream by. With "
"Shuffleboard you can put values to a GUI that is automatically "
"constructed based on your program. As values are updated, the "
"corresponding GUI element changes value - there is no need to try to "
"catch numbers streaming by on the screen."

"Depending on the data type of the values being sent to Shuffleboard you "
"can often change the display format. In the previous example you can see "
"that number values were displayed as either decimal numbers, a dial to "
"better represent angles, and as a voltage view for the turret "
"potentiometer. To set the display type right-click on the tile and select"
" \"Show as...\". You can choose display types from the list in the popup "
"menu."

"You may add code to your program to display values for your sensors and "
"actuators while the robot is in Test mode. This can be selected from the "
"Driver Station whenever the robot is not on the field. The code to "
"display these values is automatically generated by RobotBuilder or "
"manually added to your program and is described in the next article. Test"
" mode is designed to verify the correct operation of the sensors and "
"actuators on a robot. In addition it can be used for obtaining setpoints "
"from sensors such as potentiometers and for tuning PID loops in your "
"code."

"Normally network table data automatically appears on one of the tabs and "
"you just rearrange and use that data. Sometimes you might want to recover"
" a value that was accidentally deleted from the tab or display a value "
"that is not part of the SmartDashboard/ NetworkTable key. For these cases"
" the values can be dragged onto a pane from NetworkTable view under "
"Sources on the left side of the window. Choose the value that you want to"
" display and just drag it to the pane and it will be automatically "
"created with the default type of widget for the data type."

"Sometimes the Sources view is not visible on the left - it is possible to"
" drag the divider between the tabbed panes and the Sources so the sources"
" is not visible. If this happens move the cursor over the left edge and "
"look for a divider resizing cursor, then left click and drag out the "
"view. In the two images below you can see where to click and drag, and "
"when finished the divider is as shown in the second image."
