"Since the maximum speed only makes sense to be a value from 0 to 1 (full "
"stop to full speed), a slider from -1 to 1 can cause problems if the "
"value drops below zero. Fortunately, we can modify that using the "
"``withProperties`` method"

"Widgets can be specified by name; however, names are case- and "
"whitespace-sensitive (\"Number Slider\" is different from \"Number "
"slider\" and \"NumberSlider\"). For this reason, it is recommended to use"
" the built in widgets class to specify the widget instead of by raw name."
" However, a custom widget can only be specified by name or by creating a "
"custom ``WidgetType`` for that widget."
