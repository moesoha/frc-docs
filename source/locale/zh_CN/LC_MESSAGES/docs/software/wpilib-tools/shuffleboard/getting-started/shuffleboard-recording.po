"Shuffleboard can log all widget updates during a session. Later the log "
"file can be \"played back\" to see what happened during a match or a "
"practice run. This is especially useful if something doesn't operate as "
"intended during a match and you want to see what happened. Each recording"
" is captured in a recording file."

"When shuffleboard starts it begins recording to all the NetworkTable "
"values are recorded and continues until stopped by hitting the "
"record/stop button in the recorder controls as shown below. If a new "
"recording is desired, such as when a new piece of code or mechanical "
"system is being tested, stop the current recording if it is running, and "
"click the record button. Click the button again to stop recording and "
"close the recording file. If the button is round (as shown) then click it"
" to start a recording. If the button is a square, then a recoding is "
"currently running so click it to stop the recording."
