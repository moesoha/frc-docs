"There is currently an issue with inter-operating C++/Java Network Tables "

"**Workaround**: Write code on the server to mirror any keys you wish to "
"see on other clients (e.g. dashboards) to a separate key. For example, if"
" you have a key named ``targetX`` being published by a co-processor that "
"you want to show up on a dashboard, you could write code on the robot to "
"read the key and re-write it to a key like ``targetXDash``."
