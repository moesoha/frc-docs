"The WPI Robotics Library (WPILib) is the standard software library "
"provided for teams to write code for their FRC robots.  A `software "
"library <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_(computing)>`__ is a "
"collection of code that can be imported into and used by other software."
"  WPILib contains a set of useful classes and subroutines for interfacing"
" with various parts of the FRC control system (such as sensors, motor "
"controllers, and the driver station), as well as an assortment of other "
"utility functions."

"There are two versions of WPILib, one for each of the two officially-"
"supported text-based languages: WPILibJ for java, and WPILibC for C++.  A"
" considerable effort is made to maintain feature-parity between these two"
" languages - library features are not added unless they can be reasonably"
" supported for both Java and C++, and when possible the class and method "
"names are kept identical or highly-similar.  While unofficial community-"
"built support is available for some other languages, notably `python "
"<https://robotpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`__, this documentation will "
"only cover Java and C++.  Java and C++ were chosen for the officially-"
"supported languages due to their appropriate level-of-abstraction and "
"ubiquity in both industry and high-school computer science classes."

"In general, C++ offers better high-end performance, at the cost of "
"increased user effort (memory must be handled manually, and the C++ "
"compiler does not do much to ensure user code will not crash at runtime)."
"  Java offers lesser performance, but much greater convenience.  "
"New/inexperienced users are strongly encouraged to use Java."
