"Once everything is installed, we're ready to create a robot program.  "
"WPILib comes with several templates for robot programs.  Use of these "
"templates is highly recommended for new users; however, advanced users "

"To start a project using one of the WPILib robot program templates, users"
" must first choose a base class for their robot.  Users subclass these "
"base classes to create their primary :code:`Robot` class, which controls "
"the main flow of the robot program.  There are three choices available "
"for the base class:"

"The :code:`TimedRobot` class is the the base class recommended for most "

":code:`init()` and :code:`periodic()` methods, which are called by WPILib"

"default, periodic methods are called every 20ms; this can be changed by "
