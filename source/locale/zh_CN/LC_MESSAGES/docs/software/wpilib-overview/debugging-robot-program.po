"Inevitably, a program will not behave in the way we expect it to behave."
"  When this occurs, it becomes necessary to figure out why the program is"
" doing what it is doing, so that we can make it do what we want it to do,"
" instead.  Such an undesired program behavior is called a \"bug,\" and "
"this process is called \"debugging.\""

"A debugger is a tool used to control program flow and monitor variables "

"For beginning users who need to debug their programs but do not know/have"
" time to learn how to use a debugger, it is often possible to debug a "
"program simply by printing the relevant program state to the console.  "
"However, it is strongly recommended that students eventually learn to use"
" a debugger."

"A \"breakpoint\" is a line of code at which the debugger will stop the "
"program execution so that the user can examine the program state.  This "
"is extremely useful while debugging, as it allows the user to pause the "
"program at specific points in problematic code to determine where exactly"
" the program is deviating from the expected behavior."
