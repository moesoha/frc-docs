"In Safe Mode, the roboRIO boots a separate copy of the operating system "
"into a RAM Disk. This allows you to recover the roboRIO even if the "
"normal copy of the OS is corrupted. While in Safe Mode, any changes made "
"to the OS (such as changes made by accessing the device via SSH or "
"Serial) will not persist to the normal copy of the OS stored on disk."
