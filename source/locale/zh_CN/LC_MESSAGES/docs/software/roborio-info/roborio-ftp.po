"The roboRIO also has anonymous FTP enabled. It is recommended to use SFTP"
" as described above, but depending on what you need FTP may work in a "
"pinch with no additional software required. To FTP to the roboRIO, open a"
" Windows Explorer window (on Windows 7, you can click Start->My "
"Computer). In the address bar, type ftp://roboRIO-TEAM-frc.local and "
"press enter. You can now browse the roboRIO file system just like you "
"would browse files on your computer."
