"This code shows how to use a button to toggle between two distinct camera"
" modes. The code consists of four stages."

"Next, the current reading is compared to the previous reading using a "
"**Feedback Node** and some Boolean arithmetic. Together, these ensure "
"that the camera mode is only toggled when the button is initially pressed"
" rather than toggling back and forth multiple times while the button is "
"held down."

"After that, the camera mode is toggled by masking the result of the "
"second stage over the current camera mode value. This is called bit "
"masking and by doing it with the **XOR** function the code will toggle "
"the camera mode when the second stage returns true and do nothing "
"otherwise."

"Finally, you can insert the code for each camera mode in the case "
"structure at the end. Each time the code is run, this section will run "
"the code for the current camera mode."
