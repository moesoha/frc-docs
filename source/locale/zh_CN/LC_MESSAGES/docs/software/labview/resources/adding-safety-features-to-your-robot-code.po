"A common problem with complex projects is making sure that all of your "
"code is executing when you expect it to. Problems can arise when tasks "
"with high priority, long execution times, or frequent calls hog "
"processing power on the roboRIO. This leads to what is known as "
"\"starvation\" for the tasks that are not able to execute due to the "
"processor being busy. In most cases this will simply slow the reaction "
"time to your input from the joysticks and other devices. However, this "
"can also cause the drive motors of your robot to stay on long after you "
"try to stop them. To avoid any robotic catastrophes from this, you can "
"implement safety features that check for task input starvation and "
"automatically shut down potentially harmful operations."

"In all of the Safety Configuration functions, you can enable and disable "
"the safety checks while your programming is running and configure what "
"timeout you think is appropriate. The functions keep a cache of all "
"devices that have the safety enabled and will check if any of them have "
"exceeded their time limit. If any has, all devices in the cache will be "
"disabled and the robot will come to an immediate stop or have its "
"relay/PWM/solenoid outputs turned off. The code below demonstrates how to"
" use the Drive Safety Configuration functions to set a maximum time limit"
" that the motors will receive no input before being shut off."

"The final function that relates to implementing safety checks--Robot "
"Drive Delay and Update Safety--allows you to put the roboRIO in "
"Autonomous Mode without exceeding the time limit. It will maintain the "
"current motor output without making costly calls to the Drive Output "
"functions, and will also make sure that the safety checks are regularly "
"updated so that the motors will not suddenly stop."

"Overall, it is highly recommended that some sort of safety check is "
"implemented in your project to make sure that your robot is not "
"unintentionally left in a dangerous state!"
