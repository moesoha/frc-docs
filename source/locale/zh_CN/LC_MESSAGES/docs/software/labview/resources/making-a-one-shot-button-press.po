"When using the Joystick Get Values function, pushing a joystick button "
"will cause the button to read TRUE until the button is released. This "
"means that you will most likely read multiple TRUE values for each press."
" What if you want to read only one TRUE value each time the button is "
"pressed? This is often called a \"One-Shot Button\". The following "
"tutorial will show you how to create a subVI that you can drop into your "
"Teleop.vi to do this."

"This code uses a function called the Feedback Node. We have wired the "
"current value of the button into the left side of the feedback node. The "
"wire coming out of the arrow of the feedback node represents the previous"
" value of the button. If the arrow on your feedback node is going the "
"opposite direction as shown here, right click to find the option to "
"reverse the direction."

"When a button is pressed, the value of the button goes from FALSE to "
"TRUE. We want the output of this VI to be TRUE only when the current "
"value of the button is TRUE, and the previous value of the button is "
"FALSE."

"Next we need to connect the boolean control and indicator to the inputs "
"and outputs of the VI. To do this, first click the block on the connector"
" pane, then click the button to connect the two (see the diagram below). "
"Repeat this for the indicator."

"Next, we need to change the properties of this VI so that we can use "
"multiples of this VI in our TeleOp.vi. Right click the VI Icon and go to "
"VI Properties. Then select the category \"Execution\" and select "
"\"Preallocated clone reentrant execution\"."
