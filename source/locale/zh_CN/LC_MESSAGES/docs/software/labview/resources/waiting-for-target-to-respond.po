"If you download LabVIEW code which contains an unconstrained loop (a loop"
" with no delay) it is possible to get the roboRIO into a state where "
"LabVIEW is unable to connect to download new code. This document explains"

"The primary symptom of this issue is attempts to download new robot code "
"hang at the \"Waiting for the target (Target) to respond\" step as shown "
"above. Note that there are other possible causes of this symptom (such as"
" switching from a C++\\Java program to LabVIEW program) but the steps "
"described here should resolve most or all of them."

msgid ""
"One common source of this issue is unconstrained loops in your LabVIEW "
"code. An unconstrained loop is a loop which does not contain any delay "
"element (such as the one on the left). If you are unsure where to begin "
"looking, Disabled.VI, Periodic Tasks.VI and Vision Processing.VI are the "
"common locations for this type of loop. To fix the issue with the code, "
"add a delay element such as the Wait (ms) VI from the Timing palette, "
"found in the right loop."
