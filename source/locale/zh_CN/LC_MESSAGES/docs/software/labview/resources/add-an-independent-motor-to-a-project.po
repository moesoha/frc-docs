"Once your drive that controls the wheels is all set, you might need to "
"add an additional motor to control something completely independent of "
"the wheels, such as an arm. Since this motor will not be part of your "
"tank, arcade, or mecanum drive, you'll definitely want independent "
"control of it."

"These VI Snippets show how to set up a single motor in a project that may"
" already contain a multi-motor drive. If you see the HAND>ARROW>LABVIEW "
"symbol, just drag the image into your block diagram, and voila: code! Ok,"
" here's how you do it."

"FIRST, create a motor reference in the\\ **Begin.vi**, using the \\ "
"**Motor Control Open VI** and \\ **Motor Control Refnum Registry Set "
"VI**. These can be found by right-clicking in the block diagram and going"
" to **WPI Robotics Library>>RobotDrive>>Motor Control**. Choose your PWM "
"line and name your motor. I named mine \"Lift Motor\" and connected it to"
" PWM 7. (I also included and enabled the Motor Control Safety Config VI, "
"which automatically turns off the motor if it loses connection.)"

"Now, reference your motor (the name has to be exact) in the **Teleop.vi**"
" using the **Motor Control Refnum Registry Get VI** and tell it what to "
"do with the **Motor Control Set Output VI**. These are in the same place "
"as the above VIs."

"For example, the next snippet tells the Lift Motor to move forward if "
"button 4 is pressed on Joystick 0 and to remain motionless otherwise. For"
" me, button 4 is the left bumper on my Xbox style controller (\"Joystick "
"0\"). For much more in-depth joystick button options, check out How to "
"Use Joystick Buttons to Control Motors or Solenoids."

"Finally, we need to close the references in the **Finish.vi** (just like "
"we do with the drive and joystick), using the **Motor Control Refnum "
"Registry Get VI** and **Motor Control Close VI**. While this picture "
"shows the Close VI in a flat sequence structure by itself, we really want"
" all of the Close VIs in the same frame. You can just put these two VIs "
"below the other Get VIs and Close VIs (for the joystick and drive)."
