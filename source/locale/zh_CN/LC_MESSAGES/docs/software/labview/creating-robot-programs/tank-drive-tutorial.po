"**Question:** How do I get my robot to drive with two joysticks using "
"tank drive?"

"**Solution:** There are four components to consider when setting up tank "
"drive for your robot.  The first thing you will want to do is make sure "
"the tank drive.vi is used instead of the arcade drive.vi or whichever "
"drive VI you were utilizing previously.  The second item to consider is "
"how you want your joysticks to map to the direction you want to drive.  "
"In tank drive, the left joystick is used to control the left motors and "
"the right joystick is used to control the right motors.  For example, if "
"you want to make your robot turn right by pushing up on the left joystick"
" and down on the right joystick you will need to set your joystick’s "
"accordingly in LabVIEW (this is shown in more detail below).  Next, you "
"will want to confirm the PWM lines that you are wired into, are the same "
"ones your joysticks will be controlling.  Lastly, make sure your motor "
"controllers match the motor controllers specified in LabVIEW.  The steps "
"below will discuss these ideas in more detail:"

"Find the Index Array function that is after the Get Values.vi.  You will "
"need to create two numeric constants and wire each into one of the index "
"inputs.  You can determine what the values of each index should be by "
"looking at the USB Devices tab in the FRC Driver Station.  Move the two "
"joysticks to determine which number (index) they are tied to.  You will "
"likely want to use the Y-axis index for each joystick.  This is because "
"it is intuitive to push up on the joystick when you want the motors to go"
" forward, and down when you when them to go in reverse.  If you select "
"the X-axis index for each, then you will have to move the joystick left "
"or right (x-axis directions) to get the robot motors to move.  In my "
"setup, I’ve selected index 1 for my left motors Y-axis control and index "
"5 as the right motors Y-axis control.  You can see the adjustments in "
"LabVIEW in the following image:"
