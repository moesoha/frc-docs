"A number of FRC vendors offer their own CAN peripherals.  As CAN devices "
"offer expansive feature-sets, vendor CAN devices require similarly "
"expansive code libraries to operate.  As a result, these libraries are "
"not maintained as an official part of WPILib, but are instead maintained "
"by the vendors themselves.  For a guide to installing third-party "
"libraries, see :ref:`3rd Party Libraries <docs/software/getting-started"
"/3rd-party-libraries:3rd Party Libraries>`"
