"The Power Distribution Panel (PDP) can use its CAN connectivity to "
"communicate a wealth of status information regarding the robot's power "
"use to the roboRIO, for use in user code.  The PDP has the capability to "
"report its current temperature, the bus voltage, the total robot current "
"draw, the total robot energy use, and the individual current draw of each"
" device power channel.  These data can be used for a number of advanced "
"control techniques, such as motor torque limiting and brownout avoidance."
