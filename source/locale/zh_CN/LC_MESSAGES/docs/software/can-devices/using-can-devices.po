"CAN has many advantages over other methods of connection between the "
"robot controller and peripheral devices."

"CAN connections are daisy-chained from device to device, which often "
"results in much shorter wire runs than having to wire each device to the "
"RIO itself."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/software/can-devices/using-can-devices.rst:8
msgid ""
"Much more data can be sent over a CAN connection than over a PWM "
"connection - thus, CAN motor controllers are capable of a much more "
"expansive feature-set than are PWM motor controllers."

msgid ""
"CAN is bi-directional, so CAN motor controllers can send data back to the"
" RIO, again facilitating a more expansive feature-set than can be offered"
" by PWM Controllers."
