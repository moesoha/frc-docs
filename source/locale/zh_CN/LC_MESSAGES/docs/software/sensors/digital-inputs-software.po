"Digital inputs read one of two states - \"high\" or \"low.\"  By default,"
" the built-in ports on the RIO will read \"high\" due to internal pull-up"
" resistors (for more information, see :ref:`docs/hardware/sensors"
"/digital-inputs-hardware:Digital Inputs - Hardware`).  Accordingly, "
"digital inputs are most-commonly used with switches of some sort.  "
"Support for this usage is provided through the :code:`DigitalInput` class"
