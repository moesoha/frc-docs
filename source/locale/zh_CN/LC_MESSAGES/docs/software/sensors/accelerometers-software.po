"Accelerometers, as their name suggests, measure acceleration.  Precise "
"accelerometers can be used to determine position through double-"
"integration (since acceleration is the second derivative of position), "
"much in the way that gyroscopes are used to determine heading.  However, "
"the accelerometers available for use in FRC are not nearly high-enough "
"quality to be used this way."

"It is recommended to use accelerometers in FRC for any application which "
"needs a rough measurement of the current acceleration.  This can include "
"detecting collisions with other robots or field elements, so that "
"vulnerable mechanisms can be automatically retracted.  They may also be "
"used to determine when the robot is passing over rough terrain for an "
"autonomous routine (such as traversing the defenses in FIRST Stronghold)."

"For detecting collisions, it is often more robust to measure the jerk "
"than the acceleration.  The jerk is the derivative (or rate of change) of"
" acceleration, and indicates how rapidly the forces on the robot are "
"changing - the sudden impulse from a collision causes a sharp spike in "
"the jerk.  Jerk can be determined by simply taking the difference of "
"subsequent acceleration measurements, and dividing by the time between "
"them:"
