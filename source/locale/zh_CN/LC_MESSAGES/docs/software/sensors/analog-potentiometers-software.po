"Analog sensors can be used in code much in the way other sensors that "
"measure the same thing can be.  If the analog sensor is a potentiometer "
"measuring an arm angle, it can be used similarly to an :doc:`encoder "
"<encoders-software>`.  If it is an ultrasonic sensor, it can be used "
"similarly to other :doc:`ultrasonics <ultrasonics-software>`."

"It is very important to keep in mind that actual, physical potentiometers"
" generally have a limited range of motion.  Safeguards should be present "
"in both the physical mechanism and the code to ensure that the mechanism "
"does not break the sensor by traveling past its maximum throw."
