#: ../../source/docs/software/sensors/analog-inputs-software.rst:65

"Averaging behaves much like oversampling, except the accumulated values "
"are divided by the number of samples so that the scaling of the returned "

"the additional roundoff error introduced by the rounding is undesirable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/software/sensors/analog-inputs-software.rst:81
msgid ""
"When oversampling and averaging are used at the same time, the "
"oversampling is applied *first,* and then the oversampled values are "
"averaged.  Thus, 2-bit oversampling and 2-bit averaging used at the same "
"time will increase the scale of the returned values by approximately a "
"factor of 2, and decrease the update rate by approximately a factor of 4."
