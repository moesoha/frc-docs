"In order to be effective, it is often vital for robots to be able to "
"gather information about their surroundings.  Devices that provide "
"feedback to the robot on the state of its environment are called "
"\"sensors.\"  WPILib innately supports a large variety of sensors through"
" classes included in the library.  This section will provide a guide to "
"both using common sensor types through WPILib, as well as writing code "
"for sensors without official support."

"The roboRIO includes a `FPGA <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Field-"
"programmable_gate_array>`__ which allows accurate real-time measuring of "
"a variety of sensor input.  WPILib, in turn, provides a number of classes"
" for accessing this functionality."
