"In this example a listener is defined that listens for creation of "
"subtables one level down from the listener. That is subtables with the "
"key \"/datatable/<any-table-name>\". This will fire the callback for each"
" existing subtable, then continue to listen for new subtables created "
"immediately below \"datatable\" in this case."
