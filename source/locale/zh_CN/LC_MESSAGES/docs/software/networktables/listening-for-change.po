"A common use case for NetworkTables is where a program on the Driver "
"Station generates values that need to be sent to the robot. For example, "
"imagine that some image processing code running on the Driver Station "
"computes the heading and distance to a goal and sends those values to the"
" robot. In this case it might be desirable for the robot program to be "
"notified when new values arrive from the Driver Station. NetworkTables "
"provides facilities to do that."

"One of the more common cases for NetworkTables is waiting for a value to "
"change on the robot. This is called an EntryListener because it notifies "
"the robot program when a network table entry (single value) changes. The "
"following code shows how to do this."
