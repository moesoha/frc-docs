"If all you need to do is have your robot program communicate with GRIP or"
" a dashboard running on the Driver Station laptop, then the previous "
"examples of writing robot programs are sufficient. But if you would like "
"to write some custom client code that would run on the drivers station or"
" on a coprocessor then you need to know how to build Network Tables "
"programs for those (non-roboRIO) platforms."

"In this example an instance of NetworkTables is created and a "

"Then this instance is started as a NetworkTable client with the team "
"number (the roboRIO is always the server). Additionally, if the program "
"is running on the Driver Station computer, by using the startDSClient() "
"method, NetworkTables will get the robot IP address from the Driver "
"Station."

"Then this sample program simply loops once a second and gets the values "
"for x and y and prints them on the console. In a more realistic program, "
"the client might be processing or generating values for the robot to "
"consume."
