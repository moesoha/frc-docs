"Motor controllers come in two main flavors: CAN and PWM. A CAN controller"
" can send more detailed status information back to the roboRIO, whereas a"
" PWM controller can only be set to a value. For information on using "
"these motors with the WPI drivetrain classes, see :ref:`wpi_drive`."

"PWM speed controllers can be controlled in the same was as a CAN speed "
"controller. For a more detailed background on *how* they work, see "
":ref:`pwm_theory`. To use a PWM speed controller, simply use the "
"appropriate speed controller class provided by WPI and supply it the port"
" the speed controller(s) are plugged into on the roboRIO. All approved "
"motor controllers have WPI classes provided for them."
