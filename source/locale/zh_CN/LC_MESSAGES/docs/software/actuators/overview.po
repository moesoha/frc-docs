"A speed controller is responsible on your robot for making motors move. "
"For brushed DC motors such as CIMs or 775s, the speed controller "
"regulates the voltage that the motor receives, much like a light bulb. "
"For brushless speed controllers such as the Spark MAX, the controller "
"regulates the power delivered to each \"phase\" of the motor."
