"Servo motors are a type of motor which integrates positional feedback "
"into the motor in order to allow a single motor to perform repeatable, "
"controllable movement, taking position as the input signal. WPILib "
"provides the capability to control servos which match the common hobby "
"input specification (PWM signal, 1.0ms-2.0ms pulse width) Constructing a "
"Servo object"

"Scaled Value - Sets the servo position using a scaled 0 to 1.0 value. 0 "

"Angle - Set the servo position by specifying the angle, in degrees. This "
"method will work for servos with the same range as the Hitec HS-322HD "
"servo (0 to 170 degrees). Any values passed to this method outside the "
"specified range will be coerced to the boundary."
