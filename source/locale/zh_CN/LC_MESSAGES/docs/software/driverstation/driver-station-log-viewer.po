"When diagnosing robot issues, there is no substitute for thorough "

"manifest themselves in the DS Log files. Please note that depending on a "
"variety of conditions a particular failure show slightly differently in a"
" log file."

"to the \"FMS Connected:\" event. The last event shown can also be "

"When the DS disconnects from FMS, and therefore the robot, during the "

"failure are the last event of the first log, indicating that the "
"connection to FMS is now \"bad\" and the second event from the 2nd log "
"which is a new FMS connected message followed by the DS immediately "
"transitioning into Teleop Enabled. The most common cause of this type of "
"failure is an ethernet cable with no latching tab or a damaged ethernet "
"port on the DS computer."

"The \"Time since robot boot\" message is the primary indicator in a "

"loses connection with the roboRIO at 3:01:36 as indicated by the first "
"event. The second event indicates that the ping initiated after the "
"connection failed was successful to all devices other than the roboRIO. "
"At 3:01:47 the roboRIO begins responding to pings again, one additional "
"ping fails at 3:01:52. At 3:02:02 the Driver Station connects to the "
"roboRIO and the roboRIO reports that it has been up for 3.682 seconds. "
"This is a clear indicator that the roboRIO has rebooted. The code "
"continues to load and at 3:02:24 the code reports an error communicating "
"with the camera. A warning is also reported indicating that no robot code"
" is running right before the code finishes starting up."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/software/driverstation/driver-station-log-viewer.rst:105
msgid ""
"An issue with the ethernet cable on the robot is primarily indicated by "
"the ping to the roboRIO going to bad and Radio Lost and Radio Seen events"
" when the roboRIO reconnects. The \"Time since robot boot\" message when "
"the roboRIO reconnects will also indicate that the roboRIO has not "
"rebooted. In this example, the robot Ethernet cable was disconnected at "
"3:31:38. The ping status indicates that the D-Link radio is still "
"connected. When the robot reconnects at 3:32:08 the \"Tim since robot "
"boot\" is 1809 seconds indicating that the roboRIO clearly did not "
"reboot. At 3:32:12 the robot indicates that it lost the radio 24.505 "
"seconds ago and it returned 0.000 seconds ago. These points are plotted "
"as vertical lines on the graph, yellow for radio lost and green for radio"
" seen. Note that the times are slightly offset from the actual events as "
"shown via the disconnection and connection, but help to provide "
"additional information about what is occurring."

msgid "Radio reboot"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/software/driverstation/driver-station-log-viewer.rst:112
msgid ""
"A reboot of the robot radio is typically characterized by a loss of "
"connection to the radio for ~40-45 seconds. In this example, the radio "
"briefly lost power at 3:22:44, causing it to start rebooting. The event "
"at 3:22:45 indicates that the ping to the radio failed. At 3:23:11, the "
"DS regains communication with the roboRIO and the roboRIO indicates it "
"has been up for 1272.775 seconds, ruling out a roboRIO reboot. Note that "
"the network switch on the radio comes back up very quickly so a momentary"
" power loss may not result in a \"radio lost\"/\"radio seen\" event pair."
" A longer disturbance may result in radio events being logged by the DS. "
"In that case, the distinguishing factor which points towards a radio "
"reboot is the ping status of the radio from the DS. If the radio resets, "
"the radio will be unreachable. If the issue is a cabling or connection "
"issue on the robot, the radio ping should remain \"GOOD\"."
