"If you have an indicator on your dashboard that you expect to be changing"
" it may be fairly trivial to recognize if the Dashboard is connected. If "
"not, there is a way to check without making any changes to your robot "
"code. On the Variables tab of the Dashboard, the variables are shown with"
" a black diamond when they are not synced with the robot. Once the "
"Dashboard connects to the robot and these variables are synced, the "
"diamond will disappear."
