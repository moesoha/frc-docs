"When using the FMS Offseason software, the typical networking setup is to"
" use a single access point with a single SSID and WPA key. This means "
"that the radios should all be programmed to connect to this network, but "
"with different IPs for each team. The Team version of the FRC Bridge "
"Configuration Utility has an FMS-Lite mode that can be used to do this "
