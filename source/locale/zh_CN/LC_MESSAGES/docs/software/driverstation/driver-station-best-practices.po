"Want to ensure the driver station isn't a stopper for your team at the "

"Dedicate a laptop to be used solely as a driver station. Many teams do. A"
" dedicated machine allows you manage the configuration for one goal – "
"being ready to compete at the field. Dedicated means no other software "
"except the FRC-provided Driver Station software and associated Dashboard "
"installed or running."

"Use a business-class laptop for your driver station. Why? They're much "
"more durable than the $300 Black Friday special at Best Buy. They'll "
"survive being banged around at the competition. Business-class laptops "
"have higher quality device drivers, and the drivers are maintained for a "
"longer period than consumer laptops. This makes your investment last "
"longer. Lenovo ThinkPad T series and Dell Latitude are two popular "
"business-class brands you'll commonly see at competitions. There are "
"thousands for sale every day on eBay. The laptop provided in recent "
"rookie kits is a good entry level machine. Teams often graduate from it "
"to bigger displays as they do more with vision and dashboards."

"Consider used laptops rather than new. The FRC Driver Station and "
"dashboard software uses very few system resources, so you don't need to "
"buy a new laptop -- instead, buy a cheap 4-5 year old used one. You might"

"Remove any 3rd party antivirus or antimalware software. Instead, use "
