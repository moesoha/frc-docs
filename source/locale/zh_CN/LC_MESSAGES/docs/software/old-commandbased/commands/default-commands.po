"This documentation describes the use of the legacy command-based library,"
" which has been deprecated. While this documentation has been preserved "
"to help teams that have yet to do so, teams are strongly encouraged to "
"migrate to the :ref:`new command-based library "
"<docs/software/commandbased/index:Command-Based Programming>`."

"In some cases you may have a subsystem which you want to always be "
"running a command no matter what. So what do you do when the command you "
"are currently running ends? That's where default commands come in."

msgid ""
"Each subsystem may, but is not required to, have a default command which "
"is scheduled whenever the subsystem is idle (the command currently "
"requiring the system completes). The most common example of a default "
"command is a command for the drivetrain that implements the normal "
"joystick control. This command may be interrupted by other commands for "
"specific maneuvers (\"precision mode\", automatic alignment/targeting, "
"etc.) but after any command requiring the drivetrain completes the "
"joystick command would be scheduled again."

"All subsystems should contain a method called ``initDefaultCommand()`` "
"which is where you will set the default command if desired. If you do not"
" wish to have a default command, simply leave this method blank. If you "
"do wish to set a default command, call setDefaultCommand from within this"
" method, passing in the command to be set as the default."
