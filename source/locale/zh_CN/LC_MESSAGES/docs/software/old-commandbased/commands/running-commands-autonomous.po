"This documentation describes the use of the legacy command-based library,"
" which has been deprecated. While this documentation has been preserved "
"to help teams that have yet to do so, teams are strongly encouraged to "
"migrate to the :ref:`new command-based library "
"<docs/software/commandbased/index:Command-Based Programming>`."

"Once commands are defined they can run in either the teleop or autonomous"
" part of the program. In fact, the power of the command based programming"
" approach is that you can reuse the same commands in either place. If the"
" robot has a command that can shoot Frisbees during autonomous with "
"camera aiming and accurate shooting, there is no reason not to use it to "
"help the drivers during the teleop period of the game."
