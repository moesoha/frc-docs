"This documentation describes the use of the legacy command-based library,"
" which has been deprecated. While this documentation has been preserved "
"to help teams that have yet to do so, teams are strongly encouraged to "
"migrate to the :ref:`new command-based library "
"<docs/software/commandbased/index:Command-Based Programming>`."

"You can cause commands to run when joystick buttons are pressed, "
"released, or continuously while the button is held down. This is "
"extremely easy to do only requiring a few lines of code."

msgid ""
"The command based template contains a class called OI, located in "
"``OI.java``, where **Operator Interface** behaviors are typically "
"defined. If you are using RobotBuilder this file can be found in the "
"``org.usfirst.frc####.NAME`` package"

msgid ""
"In this example there is a Joystick object connected as Joystick 0. Then "
"8 buttons are defined on that joystick to control various aspects of the "
"robot. This is especially useful for testing although generating buttons "
"on SmartDashboard is another alternative for testing commands."

msgid ""
"In this example most of the joystick buttons from the previous code "
"fragment are associated with commands. When the associated button is "
"pressed the command is run. This is an excellent way to create a teleop "
"program that has buttons to do particular actions."

"In addition to the ``whenPressed()`` condition showcased above, there are"

"Commands can run when a button is released by using ``whenReleased()`` "

"Additionally commands can be triggered by arbitrary conditions of your "
"choosing by using the Trigger class instead of Button. Triggers (and "
"Buttons) are usually polled every 20ms or whenever the scheduler is "
"called."
