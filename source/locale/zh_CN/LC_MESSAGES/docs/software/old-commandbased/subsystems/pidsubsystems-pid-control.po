"This documentation describes the use of the legacy command-based library,"
" which has been deprecated. While this documentation has been preserved "
"to help teams that have yet to do so, teams are strongly encouraged to "
"migrate to the :ref:`new command-based library "
"<docs/software/commandbased/index:Command-Based Programming>`."

"If a mechanism uses a sensor for feedback, then most often a PID "
"controller will be used to control the motor speed or position. Examples "
"of subsystems that might use PID control are: elevators with "
"potentiometers to track the height, shooters with encoders to measure the"
" speed, wrists with potentiometers to measure the joint angle, etc."

"There is a PIDController class built into WPILib, but to simplify its use"
" for command based programs there is a PIDSubsystem. A PIDSubsystem is a "
"normal subsystem with the PIDController built in and exposes the required"
" methods for operation."
