"This documentation describes the use of the legacy command-based library,"
" which has been deprecated. While this documentation has been preserved "
"to help teams that have yet to do so, teams are strongly encouraged to "
"migrate to the :ref:`new command-based library "

"WPILib supports a method of writing programs called \"Command-based "
"programming\". Command-based programming is a design pattern to help you "
"organize your robot programs. Some of the characteristics of robot "
"programs that might be different from other desktop programs are:"

"These activities occur concurrently, that is it might be desirable for an"

"Often the program needs to be augmented with additional autonomous "

"Commands let you break up the tasks of operating the robot into small "
"chunks. Each command has an execute() method that does some work and an "
"isFinished() method that tells if it is done. This happens on every "
"update from the driver station or about every 20ms. Commands can be "
"grouped together and executed sequentially, starting the next one in the "
"group as the previous one finishes."

"After checking for new commands, the scheduler proceeds through the list "
"of active commands and calls the ``execute()`` and ``isFinished()`` "
"methods on each command. Notice that the apparent concurrent execution is"
" done without the use of threads or tasks which would add complexity to "
"the program. Each command simply has some code to execute (execute "
"method) to move it further along towards its goal and a method "
"(isFinished) that determines if the command has reached the goal. The "
"execute and isFinished methods are just called repeatedly."

"More complex commands can be built up from simpler commands. For example,"
" shooting a disc may be a long sequence of commands that are executed one"
" after another. Maybe some of these commands in the sequence can be "
"executed concurrently. Command groups are commands, but instead of having"
" an isFinished and execute method, they have a list of other commands to "
"execute. This allows more complex operations to be built up out of "
"simpler operations, a basic principle in programming. Each of the "
"individual smaller commands can be easily tested first, then the group "
"can be tested. More information on command groups can be found in the "
":doc:`Creating groups of commands article <../commands/creating-groups-"
"commands>`."
