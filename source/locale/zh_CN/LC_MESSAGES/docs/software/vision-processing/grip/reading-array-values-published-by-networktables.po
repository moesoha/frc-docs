"This article describes how to read values published by NetworkTables "
"using a program running on the robot. This is useful when using computer "
"vision where the images are processed on your driver station laptop and "
"the results stored into NetworkTables possibly using a separate vision "
"processor like a raspberry pi, or a tool on the robot like GRIP, or a "
"python program to do the image processing."

"Very often the values are for one or more areas of interest such as goals"
" or game pieces and multiple instances are returned. In the example "
"below, several x, y, width, height, and areas are returned by the image "
"processor and the robot program can sort out which of the returned values"
" are interesting through further processing."

"You can verify the names of the network table keys used for publishing "
"the values by using the Network Table Viewer application. It is a java "
"program in your user directory in the wpilib/tools folder. The "
"application is started by selecting the \"WPILib\" menu in eclipse then "
"\"OutlineViewer\". In this example, wth the image processing program "
"running (GRIP) you can see the values being put into NetworkTables."

"In this case the values are stored in a table called GRIP and a sub-table"
" called myContoursReport. You can see that the values are in brackets and"
" there are 2 values in this case for each key. The network table key "
"names are centerX, centerY, area, height and width."

"Both of the following examples are extremely simplified programs that "
"just illustrate the use of NetworkTables. All the code is in the "
"robotInit() method so it's only run when the program starts up. In your "
"programs, you would more likely get the values in code that is evaluating"
" which direction to aim the robot in a command or a control loop during "
"the autonomous or teleop periods."

"Read the array of values from NetworkTables. In the case of a "

"of values is supplied. This default value will be returned if the network"
" table key hasn't yet been published. This code will loop over the value "

"In this case the program is only looking at the array of areas, but in a "
"real example all the values would more likely be used. Using the Riolog "
"in eclipse or the DriverStation log you can see the values as they are "
"retrieved. This program is using a sample static image so they areas "
"don't change, but you can imagine with a camera on your robot, the values"
" would be changing constantly."
