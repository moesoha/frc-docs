"The convention for using the Axis camera uses mDNS with the camera name "
"set to ``axis-camera.local``. At home, this works fine as there is only "
"one camera on the network. At official events, this works fine as each "
"team is on their own VLAN and therefore doesn't have visibility to "
"another team's camera. However, at an off-season event using a single "
"network, this will cause an issue where all teams will connect to "
"whichever team's camera \"wins\" the mDNS resolution and becomes ``axis-"
"camera``. The other cameras will see that the name is taken and use an "
"alternative name. This article describes how to modify the Dashboard "
"and/or robot code to use a different mDNS name to separate the camera "
"streams."
