"The Microsoft Lifecam HD-3000 is a USB webcam that was tested with the "
"roboRIO as part of the Beta testing and software development effort. "
"While other USB webcams may work with the roboRIO, this camera has been "
"tested to be compatible with the provided software."

"To stream the camera back to the Dashboard using LabVIEW, no additional "
"code is necessary. Simply select USB HW (image compression done by the "
"camera, fewer options but lower roboRIO CPU usage) or USB SW (image "
"compressed by roboRIO, more options, but higher roboRIO CPU usage) and "
"the image should begin streaming back."
