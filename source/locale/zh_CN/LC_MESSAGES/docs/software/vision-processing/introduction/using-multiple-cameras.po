"If you're interested in just switching what the driver sees, and are "
"using SmartDashboard, the SmartDashboard CameraServer Stream Viewer has "
"an option (\"Selected Camera Path\") that reads the given NT key and "
"changes the \"Camera Choice\" to that value (displaying that camera). The"
" robot code then just needs to set the NT key to the correct camera name."
" Assuming \"Selected Camera Path\" is set to \"CameraSelection\", the "
"following code uses the joystick 1 trigger button state to show camera1 "
"and camera2."

msgid ""
"If you're using some other dashboard, you can change the camera used by "
"the camera server dynamically. If you open a stream viewer nominally to "
"camera1, the robot code will change the stream contents to either camera1"
" or camera2 based on the joystick trigger."

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"By default, the cscore library is pretty aggressive in turning off "
"cameras not in use. What this means is that when you switch cameras, it "
"may disconnect from the camera not in use, so switching back will have "
"some delay as it reconnects to the camera. To keep both camera "
"connections open, use the ``SetConnectionStrategy()`` method to tell the "
"library to keep the streams open, even if you aren't using them."

msgid ""
"If both cameras are USB, you may run into USB bandwidth limitations with "
"higher resolutions, as in all of these cases the roboRIO is going to be "
"streaming data from both cameras to the roboRIO simultaneously (for a "
"short period in options 1 and 2, and continuously in option 3). It is "
"theoretically possible for the library to avoid this simultaneity in the "
"option 2 case (only), but this is not currently implemented."

"Different cameras report bandwidth usage differently. The library will "
"tell you if you're hitting the limit; you'll get this error message:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/software/vision-processing/introduction/using-multiple-cameras.rst:188
msgid ""
"If you're using Option 3 it will give you this error during "
"``RobotInit()``. Thus you should just try your desired resolution and "
"adjusting as necessary until you both don't get that error and don't "
"exceed the radio bandwidth limitations."
