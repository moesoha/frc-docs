"While many of the numbers for the Vision Processing code can be "
"determined theoretically, there are a few parameters that are typically "
"best to measure empirically then enter back into the code (a process "
"typically known as calibration). This article will show how to perform "
"calibration for the Color (masking), and View Angle (distance) using the "
"NI Vision Assistant. If you are using C++ or Java and have not yet "
"installed the NI Vision Assistant, see the article Installing NI Vision "

"While a theoretical view angle for each camera model can be found in the "
"datasheet, empirical testing has found that these numbers may be a bit "
"off even for the horizontal view angle. Given that this year's code uses "
"the vertical field-of-view it is best to perform your own calibration for"
" your camera (though empirical values for each camera type are included "
"in the code as a reference). To do this set up an equation where the view"
" angle, |theta|, is the only unknown. To do this, utilize a target of "
"known size at a known distance, leaving the view angle as the only "
"unknown. Let's take our equation from the previous article, :math:`d = "
"T_{\\mathrm{ft}} \\cdot "
"\\frac{\\textit{FOV}_{\\mathrm{pixel}}}{T_{\\mathrm{pixel}}\\tan\\theta}`,"
" and re-arrange it to solve for |theta|:"

"The code uses View Angle and we just calculated |theta|. Make sure to "

" ballpark and likely performed the calculation correctly."
