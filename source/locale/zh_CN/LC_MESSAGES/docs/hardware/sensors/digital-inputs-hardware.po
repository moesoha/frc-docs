"A `digital signal <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signal>`__ is a "
"signal that can be in one of several discrete states.  In the vast "
"majority of cases, the signal is the voltage in a wire, and there are "
"only two states for a digital signal - high, or low (also denoted 1 and "
"0, or true and false, respectively)."

"The roboRIO's built-in digital input-output ports (or \"DIO\") ports "
"function on 5V, so \"high\" corresponds to a signal of 5V, and \"low\" to"

"The roboRIO has 10 built-in DIO ports (numbered 0-9), as seen in the "
"image above.  Each port has three pins - signal (\"S\"), power (\"V\"), "
"and ground (\"|ground|\").  The \"power\" and \"ground\" pins are used to"
" power the peripheral sensors that connect to the DIO ports - there is a "
"constant 5V potential difference between the \"power\" and the \"ground\""
" pins [3]_ - the \"power\" pin corresponds to the \"high\" state (5V), "
"and the \"ground\" to \"low\" (0V).  The signal pin is the pin on which "
"the signal is actually measured (or, when used as an output, the pin that"
" sends the signal)."

"All DIO ports have built in \"pull-up\" resistors between the power pins "
