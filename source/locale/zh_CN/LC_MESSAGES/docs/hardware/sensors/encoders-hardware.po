"Quadrature encoders are by far the most common method for measuring "
"rotational motion in FRC, and for good reason - they are cheap, easy-to-"
"use, and reliable.  As they produce digital signals, they are less-prone "
"to noise and interference than analog devices (such as "
":doc:`potentiometers <analog-potentiometers-hardware>`)."

"The term \"quadrature\" refers to the method by which the motion is "
"measured/encoded.  A quadrature encoder produces two square-wave pulses "
"that are 90-degrees out-of-phase from each other, as seen in the picture "

"Shafted encoders have a sealed body with a shaft protruding out of it "
"that must be coupled rotationally to a mechanism.  This is often done "
"with a helical beam coupling, or, more cheaply, with a length of flexible"
" tubing (such as surgical tubing or pneumatic tubing), fastened with "
"cable ties and/or adhesive at either end.  Many commercial off-the-shelf "
"FRC gearboxes have purpose-built mounting points for shafted encoders, "
"such as the popular `Grayhill 63r "

"In general, the resolution of your encoder in edges-per-revolution should"
