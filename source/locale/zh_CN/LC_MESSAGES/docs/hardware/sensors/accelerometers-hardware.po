"In principle, precise measurements of acceleration can be double-"
"integrated and used to track position (similarly to how the measurement "
"of turn rate from a gyroscope can be integrated to determine heading) - "
"however, in practice, accelerometers that are available within the legal "
"FRC price range are not nearly accurate for this use.  However, "
"accelerometers are still useful for a number of tasks in FRC."

"As per their name, single-axis accelerometers measure acceleration along "
"a single axis.  This axis is generally specified on the physical device, "
"and mounting the device in the proper orientation so that the desired "
