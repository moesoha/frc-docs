"Triangulating rangefinders (often called \"IR rangefinders,\" as they "
"commonly function in the infrared wavelength band) are another common "
"type of rangefinder used in FRC."

msgid ""
"Unlike :doc:`LIDAR <lidar>`, triangulating rangefinders do not measure "
"the time between the emission of a pulse and the receiving of a "
"reflection.  Rather, most IR rangefinders work by emitting a constant "
"beam at a slight angle, and measuring the position of the reflected beam."
"  The closer the point of contact of the reflected beam to the emitter, "
"the closer the object to the sensor."

"IR Rangefinders generally output an analog voltage proportional to the "
"distance to the target, and thus connect to the :doc:`analog input "
"<analog-inputs-hardware>` ports on the RIO."

"IR rangefinders suffer similar drawbacks to 1D LIDAR sensors - they are "
"very sensitive to the reflectivity of the target in the wavelength of the"
" emitted laser."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/hardware/sensors/triangulating-rangefinders.rst:20
msgid ""
"Additionally, while IR rangefinders tend to offer better resolution than "
"LIDAR sensors when measuring at short distances, they are also usually "
"more sensitive to differences in orientation of the target, *especially* "
"if the target is highly-reflective (such as a mirror)."
