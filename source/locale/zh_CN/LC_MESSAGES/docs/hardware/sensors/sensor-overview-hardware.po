"In order to be effective, it is often vital for robots to be able to "
"gather information about their surroundings.  Devices that provide "
"feedback to the robot on the state of its environment are called "
"\"sensors.\"  There are a large variety of sensors available to FRC "
"teams, for measuring everything from on-field positioning to robot "
"orientation to motor/mechanism positioning.  Making use of sensors is an "
"absolutely crucial skill for on-field success; while most FRC games do "
"have tasks that can be accomplished by a \"blind\" robot, the best robots"
" rely heavily on sensors to accomplish game tasks as quickly and reliably"
" as possible."

"Additionally, sensors can be extremely important for robot safety - many "
"robot mechanisms are capable of breaking themselves if used incorrectly."
"  Sensors provide a safeguard against this, allowing robots to, for "
"example, disable a motor if a mechanism is against a hard-stop."

"Sensors used in FRC can be generally categorized in two different ways: "
