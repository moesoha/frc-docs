"Potentiometers generally have a mechanically-limited travel range.  Users"
" should be careful that their mechanisms do not turn their potentiometers"
" past their maximum travel, as this will damage or destroy the "
"potentiometer."

"Apart from :doc:`quadrature encoders <encoders-hardware>`, another common"
" way of measuring rotation on FRC robots is with analog potentiometers.  "
"A potentiometer is simply a variable resistor - as the shaft of the "
"potentiometer turns, the resistance changes (usually linearly).  Placing "
"this resistor in a `voltage divider "
"<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voltage_divider>`__ allows the user to "
"easily measure the resistance by measuring the voltage across the "
"potentiometer, which can then be used to calculate the rotational "
"position of the shaft."

"As suggested by the names, analog potentiometers connect to the roboRIO's"
" :doc:`analog input <analog-inputs-hardware>` ports.  To understand how "
"exactly to wire potentiometers, however, it is important to understand "

"The picture above on the left shows a typical potentiometer.  There are "
"three pins, just as there are on the RIO's analog inputs.  The middle pin"
" is the signal pin, while the outer pins can both be *either* power or "
"ground."

"As mentioned before, a potentiometer is a voltage divider, as shown in "
"the circuit diagram on the right.  As the potentiometer shaft turns, the "
"resistances R1 and R2 change; however, their sum remains constant [1]_.  "
"Thus, the voltage across the entire potentiometer remains constant (for "
"the roboRIO, this would be 5 volts), but the voltage between the signal "
"pin and either the voltage or ground pin varies linearly as the shaft "
"turns."

"Since the circuit is symmetric, it is reversible - this allows the user "
"to choose at which end of the travel the measured voltage is zero, and at"
" which end it is 5 volts.  To reverse the directionality of the sensor, "
"it can simply be wired backwards!  Be sure to check the directionality of"
" your potentiometer with a multimeter to be sure it is in the desired "
"orientation before soldering your wires to the contacts."

"An \"absolute encoder\" is an encoder that measures the absolute position"
" of the encoder shaft, rather than the incremental movement (as a "
":doc:`quadrature encoder <encoders-hardware>`) does.  In this respect, "
"absolute encoders are more similar to potentiometers than to incremental "
"encoders.  Many absolute encoders offer a simple analog output - these "
"can be used exactly in the same way as a potentiometer, except their "
"wiring is not generally reversible.  Absolute encoders have the advantage"
" of lacking a hard travel limit - the signal will simply reset when the "
"shaft crosses the zero point."

"The way this actually works is generally by having the shaft control the "
"position of a contact along a resistive \"wiper\" of fixed length along "
"which the current flows - the resistance is proportional to the length of"
" wiper between the contact and the end of the wiper."
