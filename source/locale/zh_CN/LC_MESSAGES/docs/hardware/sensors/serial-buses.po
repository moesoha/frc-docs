"In addition to the :doc:`digital <digital-inputs-hardware>` and "
":doc:`analog <analog-inputs-hardware>` inputs, the roboRIO also offers "
"several methods of serial communication with peripheral devices."

"Both the digital and analog inputs are highly limited in the amount of "
"data that can be send over them.  Serial buses allow users to make use of"
" far more-robust and higher-bandwidth communications protocols with "
"sensors that collect large amounts of data, such as inertial measurement "
"units (IMUs) or 2D LIDAR sensors."
