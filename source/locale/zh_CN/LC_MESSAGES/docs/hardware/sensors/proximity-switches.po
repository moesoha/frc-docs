"Proximity switches are switches - they operate a circuit between an "
"\"open\" state (in which there *is not* connectivity across the circuit) "
"and a \"closed\" one (in which there *is*).  Thus, proximity switches "
"generate a digital signal, and accordingly, they are almost always "
"connected to the roboRIO's :doc:`digital input <digital-inputs-hardware>`"
" ports."

"Proximity switches can be either \"normally-open,\" in which activating "
"the switch closes the circuit, or \"normally closed,\" in which "
"activating the switch opens the circuit.  Some switches offer *both* a NO"
" and a NC circuit connected to the same switch.  In practice, the "
"effective difference between a NO and a NC switch is the behavior of the "
"system in the case that the wiring to the switch fails, as a wiring "
"failure will almost always result in an open circuit.  NO switches are "
"often \"safer,\" in that a wiring failure causes the system to behave as "
"if the switch were pressed - as switches are often used to prevent a "
"mechanism from damaging itself, this mitigates the chance of damage to "
"the mechanism in the case of a wiring fault."

"Mechanical proximity switches (more commonly known as \"limit switches\")"
" are probably the most-commonly used proximity switch in FRC, due to "
"their simplicity, ease-of-use, and low cost.  A limit switch is quite "
"simply a switch attached to a mechanical arm.  The switch is activated "
"when an object pushes against the switch arm, actuating the switch."

"Limit switches vary in size, the geometry of the switch-arm, and in the "
"amount of \"throw\" required to activate the switch.  While limit "
"switches are quite cheap, their mechanical actuation is sometimes less-"
"reliable than no-contact alternatives.  However, they are also extremely "
"versatile, as they can be triggered by any physical object capable of "
"moving the switch arm."

"There are two major types of magnetic proximity switches - reed switches "
"and hall-effect sensors.  In a reed switch, the magnetic field causes a "
"pair of flexible metal contacts (the \"reeds\") to touch each other, "
"closing the circuit.  A hall-effect sensor, on the other hand, detects "
"the induced voltage transversely across a current-carrying conductor.  "
"Hall-effect sensors are generally the cheaper and more-reliable of the "
"two."

"Magnetic proximity switches may be either \"unipolar,\" \"bipolar,\" or "
"\"omnipolar.\"  A unipolar switch activates and deactivates depending on "
"the presence of a given pole of the magnet (either north or south, "
"depending on the switch).  A bipolar switch activates from the proximity "
"of one pole, and deactivates from the proximity of the opposite pole.  An"
" omnipolar switch will activate in the presence of either pole, and "
"deactivates when no magnet is present."

"Photoelectric proximity switches are the last type of no-contact "
"proximity switch in widespread use in FRC.  Photoelectric proximity "
"switches contain a light source (usually an IR laser) and a photoelectric"
" sensor that activates the switch when the detected light (which bounces "
"off of the sensor target) exceeds a given threshold."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/hardware/sensors/proximity-switches.rst:63
msgid ""
"Since photoelectric proximity switches rely on measuring the amount of "
"reflected light, they are often inconsistent in their triggering range "
"between different materials - accordingly, most photoelectric sensors "
"have an adjustable activation point (typically controller by turning a "
"screw somewhere on the sensor body).  On the other hand, photoelectric "
"sensors are also extremely versatile, as they can detect a greater "
"variety of objects than the other types of no-contact switches."

"Photoelectric sensors are also often often used in a \"beam break\" "
"configuration, in which the emitter is separate from the sensor.  These "
"typically activate when an object is interposed between the emitter and "
"the sensor."
