"LIDAR (light detection and ranging) sensors are a variety of rangefinder "

"LIDAR sensors work quite similarly to :doc:`ultrasonics <ultrasonics-"
"hardware>`, but use light instead of sound.  A laser is pulsed, and the "
"sensor measures the time until the pulse bounces back."

"A 1-dimensional (1D) LIDAR sensor works much like an ultrasonic sensor - "
"it measures the distance to the nearest object more or less along a line "
"in front of it.  1D LIDAR sensors can often be more-reliable than "
"ultrasonics, as they have narrower \"beam profiles\" and are less "
"susceptible to interference."

"1D LIDAR sensors generally output an analog voltage proportional to the "
"measured distance, and thus connect to the roboRIO's :doc:`analog input "
"<analog-inputs-hardware>` ports."

"A 2-dimensional (2D) LIDAR sensor measures distance in all directions in "
"a plane.  Generally, this is accomplished (more-or-less) by simply "
"placing a 1D LIDAR sensor on a turntable that spins at a constant rate."

"Since, by nature, 2D LIDAR sensors need to send a large amount of data "
"back to the roboRIO, they almost always connect to one of the roboRIO's "
":doc:`serial buses <serial-buses>`."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/hardware/sensors/lidar.rst:36
msgid ""
"Like ultrasonics, LIDAR relies on the reflection of the emitted pulse "
"back to the sensor.  Thus, LIDAR critically depends on the reflectivity "
"of the material in the wavelength of the laser.  The FRC field wall is "
"made of polycarbonate, which tends to be transparent in the infrared "
"wavelength (which is what is generally legal for FRC use).  Thus, LIDAR "
"tends to struggle to detect the field barrier."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/hardware/sensors/lidar.rst:38
msgid ""
"2D LIDAR sensors (at the price range legal for FRC use) tend to be quite "
"noisy, and processing their measured data (known as a \"point cloud\") "
"can involve a lot of complex software.  Additionally, there are very few "
"2D LIDAR sensors made specifically for FRC, so software support tends to "
"be scarce."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/hardware/sensors/lidar.rst:40
msgid ""
"As 2D LIDAR sensors rely on a turntable to work, their update rate is "
"limited by the rate at which the turntable spins.  For sensors in the "
"price range legal for FRC, this often means that they do not update their"
" values particularly quickly, which can be a limitation when the robot "
"(or the targets) are moving."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/hardware/sensors/lidar.rst:42
msgid ""
"Additionally, as 2D LIDAR sensors are limited in *angular* resolution, "
"the *spatial* resolution of the point cloud is worse when targets are "
"further away."
