"An `analog signal <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analog_signal>`__ is a "
"signal whose value can lie anywhere in a continuous interval.  This lies "
"in stark contrast to a :doc:`digital signal <digital-inputs-hardware>`, "
"which can take only one of several discrete values.  The roboRIO's analog"
" input ports allow the measurement of analog signals with values from 0V "
"to 5V."

"In practice, there is no way to measure a \"true\" analog signal with a "
"digital device such as a computer (like the roboRIO).  Accordingly, the "
"analog inputs are actually measured as a 12-bit digital signal - however,"
" this is quite a high resolution [1]_."

"Analog inputs are typically (but not always!) used for sensors whose "
"measurements vary continuously over a range, such as :doc:`ultrasonic "
"rangefinders <ultrasonics-hardware>` and :doc:`potentiometers <analog-"
"potentiometers-hardware>`, as they can communicate by outputting a "
"voltage proportional to their measurements."

"The roboRIO has 4 built-in analog input ports (numbered 0-3), as seen in "
"the image above.  Each port has three pins - signal (\"S\"), power "
"(\"V\"), and ground (\"|ground|\").  The \"power\" and \"ground\" pins "
"are used to power the peripheral sensors that connect to the analog input"
" ports - there is a constant 5V potential difference between the "
"\"power\" and the \"ground\" pins [2]_.  The signal pin is the pin on "
