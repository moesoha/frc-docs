"Ultrasonic rangefinders are some of the most common rangefinders used in "
"FRC.  They are cheap, easy-to-use, and fairly reliable.  Ultrasonic "
"rangefinders work by emitting a pulse of high-frequency sound, and then "
"measuring how long it takes the echo to reach the sensor after bouncing "
"off the target.  From the measured time and the speed of sound in air, it"
" is possible to calculate the distance to the target."

"Ultrasonic sensors are generally quite easy to use, however there are a "
"few caveats.  As ultrasonics work by measuring the time between the pulse"
" and its echo, they generally measure distance only to the *closest* "
"target in their range.  Thus, it is extremely important to pick a the "
"right sensor for the job.  The documentation for ultrasonic sensors will "
"generally include a picture of the \"beam pattern\" that shows the shape "
"of the \"window\" in which the ultrasonic will detect a target - pay "
"close attention to this when selecting your sensor."

"Ultrasonic sensors are also susceptible to interference from other "
"ultrasonic sensors.  In order to minimize this, the roboRIO can run ping-"
"response ultrasonics in a \"round-robin\" fashion - however, in "
"competition, there is no sure way to ensure that interference from "
"sensors mounted on other robots does not occur."

"Finally, ultrasonics may not be able to detect objects that absorb sound "
"waves, or that redirect them in strange ways.  Thus, they work best for "
"detecting hard, flat objects."
