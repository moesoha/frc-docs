"An FRC Robot is an incredibly rough environment when it comes to "
"vibrations and shock loads. While many of the FRC specific electronics "
"are extensively tested for mechanical robustness in these conditions, a "
"few components, such as the radio, are not specifically designed for use "
"on a mobile platform. Taking steps to reduce the shock and vibration "
"these components are exposed to may help reduce failures. Some "
"suggestions that may reduce mechanical failures:"
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Vibration Isolation - Make sure to isolate any components which create "
"excessive vibration, such as compressors, using \"vibration isolators\". "
"This will help reduce vibration on the robot which can loosen fasteners "
"and cause premature fatigue failure on some electronic components."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/hardware/getting-started/wiring-best-practices.rst:15
msgid ""
"Bumpers - Use Bumpers to cover as much of the robot as possible for your "
"design. While the rules require specific bumper coverage around the "
"corners of your robot, maximizing the use of bumpers increases the "
"likelihood that all collisions will be damped by your bumpers. Bumpers "
"significantly reduce the g-forces experienced in a collision compared to "
"hitting directly on a hard robot surface, reducing the shock experienced "
"by the electronics and decreasing the chance of a shock related failure."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Shock Mounting - You may choose to shock mount some or all of your "
"electronic components to further reduce the forces they see in robot "
"collisions. This is especially helpful for the robot radio and other "
"electronics such as co-processors, which may not be designed for use on "
"mobile platforms. Vibration isolators, springs, foams, or mounting to "
"flexible materials all may reduce the shock forces seen by these "
"components."

"Unfortunately there are few places in the FRC Control System where "
"redundancy is feasible. Taking advantage of opportunities for redundancy "
"can increase reliability. The primary example of this is wiring the "
"barrel connector to the radio in addition to the provided PoE connection."
" This ensures that if one of the cables becomes damaged or dislodged, the"
" other will maintain power to the radio. Keep an eye out for other "
"potential areas to provide redundancy when wiring and programming your "
"robot."

"For any connections on the Robot or Driver station that may be frequently"
" plugged and unplugged (such as DS joysticks, DS Ethernet, roboRIO USB "
"tether, and Ethernet tether) using a \"Port Saver\" or \"pigtail\" can "
"substantially reduce the potential for damaging the port. This type of "
"device can serve double duty, both reducing the number of cycles that the"
" port on the electronic device sees, as well as relocating the connection"
" to a more convenient location. Make sure to secure the port saver (see "
"the next item) to avoid port damage."

"One of the most critical components to robot reliability and maintenance "

"comprised of a few components:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/hardware/getting-started/wiring-best-practices.rst:33
msgid ""
"Make sure cables are the correct length. Any excess wire length is just "
"more to manage. If you must have extra wire due to additional length on "
"COTS cabling, secure the extra into a small bundle using separate cable "
"ties before securing the rest of the wire."
msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/hardware/getting-started/wiring-best-practices.rst:34
msgid ""
"Ensure that cables are secured close to connection points, with enough "
"slack to avoid putting strain on connectors. This is called strain "
"relief, and is critical to minimizing the likelihood that a cable comes "
"unplugged or a wire breaks off at a connection point (these are generally"
" stress concentrators)."

msgstr ""

#: ../../source/docs/hardware/getting-started/wiring-best-practices.rst:41
msgid ""
"A great way to make maintenance easier is to create documentation "
"describing what is connected where on the robot. There are a number of "
"ways of creating this type of documentation which range from complete "
"wiring diagrams to excel charts to a quick list of what functions are "
"attached to which channels. Many teams also integrate these lists with "
"labeling (see the next bullet)."

"When a wire is accidentally cut, or a mechanism is malfunctioning, or a "
"component burns out, it will be much easier to repair if you have some "
"documentation to tell you what is connected where without having to trace"
" the wiring all the way through (even if your wiring is neat!)"

msgid "Labeling"

"Labeling is a great way to supplement the wiring documentation described "
"above. There are many different strategies to labeling wiring and "
"electronics, all with their own pros and cons. Labels for electronics and"
" flags for wires can be made by hand, or using a label maker (some can "
"also do heat-shrink labels), or you can use different colors of "
"electrical tape or labeling flags to indicate different things. Whatever "
"system you choose, make sure you understand how it complements your "
"documentation and make sure everyone on your team is familiar with it."

"After all wiring on the robot is complete, make sure to check each "
"connection, pulling on each, to ensure that everything is secure. "
"Additionally, ensure that no stray wire \"whiskers\" are sticking out of "
"any connection point and that no uninsulated connections are exposed. If "
"any connections come loose while testing, or any \"whiskers\" are "
"discovered, re-make the connection and make sure to have a second person "
"check it when complete."

"A common source of poor connections is screw-type or nut-and-bolt "
"fasteners. For any connections of this type on the robot (e.g. battery "
"connections, main breaker, PDP, roboRIO), make sure the fasteners are "
"tight. For nut-and-bolt style connections, ensure that the wire/terminal "
"cannot be rotate by hand; if you can rotate your battery wire or main "
"breaker connection by grasping the terminal and twisting, the connection "
"is not tight enough."

"Another common source of failures is the fuses at the end of the PDP. "
"Ensure these fuses are completely seated; you may need to apply more "
"force than you expect to seat them completely. If the fuses are seated "
"properly they will likely be difficult or impossible to remove by hand."

"Re-check the entire electrical system as thoroughly as possible after "

msgid ""
"Create a checklist for re-checking electrical connections on a regular "
"basis. As a very rough starting point, rotational fasteners such as "
"battery and PDP connections should be checked every 1-3 matches. Spring "
"type connections such as the WAGO and Weidmuller connectors likely only "
"need to be checked once per event. Ensure that the team knows who is "
"responsible for completing the checklist and how they will document that "
"it has been done."
