"Wiring pneumatics has been made very simple in the 2019 Control System. A"
" single Pneumatics Control Module is all that will be needed for many "
"pneumatics applications, with additional PCMs supporting more complex "
"designs including more than 8 solenoid channels or a mix of 12V and 24V "
"solenoids."

"A single PCM will support many pneumatics applications, providing an "
"output for the compressor, input for the pressure switch and outputs for "
"up to 8 solenoid channels (12V or 24V selectable). The module is "
"connected to the roboRIO over the CAN bus and powered via 12V from the "
"PDP."

"The first PCM on your robot can be wired from the PDP VRM/PCM connectors "
"on the end of the PDP. The PCM is connected to the roboRIO via CAN and "
"can be placed anywhere in the middle of the CAN chain (or on the end with"
" a custom terminator). For more details on wiring a single PCM see Wiring"
" the 2015 FRC Control System. Additional PCMs can be wired to a standard "
"WAGO connector on the side of the PDP and protected with a 20A or smaller"
" circuit breaker. Additional PCMs should also be placed anywhere in the "
"middle of the CAN chain."

"The compressor can be wired directly to the Compressor Out connectors on "

"or larger for the extension."

"The pressure switch should be connected directly to the pressure switch "
"input terminals on the PCM. There is no polarity on the input terminals "
"or on the pressure switch itself, either terminal on the PCM can be "
"connected to either terminal on the switch. Ring or spade terminals are "
"recommended for the connection to the switch screws (note that the screws"
" are slightly larger than #6, but can be threaded through a ring terminal"
" with a hole for a #6 screw such as the terminals shown in the image)."

"Each solenoid channel should be wired directly to a numbered pair of "
"terminals on the PCM. A single acting solenoid will use one numbered "
"terminal pair. A double acting solenoid will use two pairs (as shown in "
"the image above). If your solenoid does not come with color coded wiring,"
" check the datasheet to make sure to wire with the proper polarity."

msgid ""
"The PCM is capable of powering either 12V or 24V solenoids, but all "
"solenoids connected to a single PCM must be the same voltage. The PCM "
"ships with the jumper in the 12V position as shown in the image. To use "
"24V solenoids move the jumper from the left two pins (as shown in the "
"image) to the right two pins. The overlay on the PCM also indicates which"
" position corresponds to which voltage. You may need to use a tool such "
"as a small screwdriver, small pair of pliers, or a pair of tweezers to "
"remove the jumper."
