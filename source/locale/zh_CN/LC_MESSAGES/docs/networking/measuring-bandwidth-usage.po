"On the FRC Field (and at home when the radio is configured using the FRC "
"Bridge Configuration Utility) each team is limited to 4Mb/s of network "
"traffic (see the `FMS Whitepaper "
"<https://wpilib.screenstepslive.com/s/fms/m/whitepaper/l/608744-fms-"
"whitepaper>`__ for more details). The FMS Whitepaper provides information"
" on determining the bandwidth usage of the Axis camera, but some teams "
"may wish to measure their overall bandwidth consumption. This document "
"details how to make that measurement."
