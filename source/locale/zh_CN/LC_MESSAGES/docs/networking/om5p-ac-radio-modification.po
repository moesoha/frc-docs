"The intended use case for the OM5P-AC radio does not subject it to the "
"same shocks and forces as it sees in the FRC environment. If the radio is"
" subjected to significant pressure on the bottom of the case, it is "
"possible to cause a radio reboot by shorting a metal shield at the bottom"
" of the radio to some exposed metal leads on the bottom of the board. "
"This article details a modification to the radio to prevent this "
"scenario."

"It takes significant pressure applied to the bottom of the case to cause "
"a reboot in this manner. Most FRC radio reboot issues can be traced to "
"the power path in some form. We recommend mitigating this risk via "
"strategic mounting of the radio rather than opening and modifying the "
"radio (and risk damaging delicate internal components):"

"You may wish to mount the radio to allow for some shock absorption. A "
"little can go a long way, mounting the radio using hook and loop fastener"
" or to a robot surface with a small amount of flex (plastic or sheet "

"side (note: it's not hard to accidentally re-latch the first side while "
