"The first step to identifying roboRIO networking issues is to isolate if "
"it is an application issue or a general network issue. To do this, click "
"**Start -> type cmd -> press Enter** to open the command prompt. Type "
"``ping roboRIO-####-FRC.local`` where #### is your team number (with no "
"leading zeroes) and press enter. If the ping succeeds, the issue is "
"likely with the specific application, verify your team number "
"configuration in the application, and check your firewall configuration."

"If you are attempting to troubleshoot the USB connection, try pinging the"
" roboRIO's IP address. As long as there is only one roboRIO connected to "
"the PC, it should be configured as 172.22.11.2. If this ping fails, make "
"sure you have the roboRIO connected and powered, and that you have "
"installed the NI FRC Update Suite. This update installs the roboRIO "
"drivers needed for the USB connection."

"If this ping succeeds, but the .local ping fails, it is likely that "

"If you are troubleshooting an Ethernet connection, it may be helpful to "

"connection. Using the USB connection, open the :ref:`roboRIO webdashboard"
" <docs/software/roborio-info/roborio-web-dashboard:roboRIO Web "
"Dashboard>` and verify that the roboRIO has an IP address on the ethernet"
" interface. If you are tethering to the roboRIO directly this should be a"
" self-assigned ``169.*.*.*`` address, if you are connected to the OM5P-AN"
" radio, it should be an address of the form ``10.TE.AM.XX`` where TEAM is"
" your four digit FRC team number. If the only IP address here is the USB "
"address, verify the physical roboRIO ethernet connection."

"If there is an IP address in the step above, try pinging this IP address "

" DNS."
